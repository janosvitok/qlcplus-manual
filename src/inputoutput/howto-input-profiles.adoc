== Input Profiles Howto

This howto document tells you how to associate input profiles to input
universes and how to edit these profiles. You should first read the
link:howto-input-output-mapping.html[howto on input/output mapping] so
that you can access the input/output manager and know how to edit input
universes.

=== Input Profile Manager

To access the Input/Output Manager, just click on the tab with the
image:../icons/input_output.png[../icons/input_output,width=32] icon
placed on the bottom of the QLC+ main screen. +
Select the desired universe on the left part of the screen and then
click the [.underline]#Profile# tab placed beside the
[.underline]#Mapping# tab on the top right part of the screen.

=== Profile assignment

You will see a list of available input profile definitions, with a check
mark on [.underline]#None#. This means that the current universe doesn't
have a profile assigned yet. To assign a profile to the universe, simply
place a check mark on one of the available profiles by clicking on the
empty check box. Only one profile can be assigned to one universe at a
time, so the check mark will actually [.underline]#move# from its
previous position to the item that you have just selected.

=== Add/Edit a Profile

It is probable that your input profile is not on the list and you need
to create one on your own.

*Click the image:../icons/edit_add.png[../icons/edit_add] create new
input profile button to start making a profile definition for your input
profile. Alternatively, you can edit any existing profile by selecting
the appropriate item and clicking the
image:../icons/edit.png[../icons/edit] edit button. The procedure is
exactly the same in both cases from now on.*

=== Input Profile Editor

A dialog is opened with entry fields for [.underline]#Manufacturer#,
[.underline]#Model# and [.underline]#Type#.

*First enter the profile's manufacturer and the model to these fields
and select profile type.*

*Type* is one of:

* MIDI - for MIDI profiles, usually used with link:midiplugin.html[MIDI
plugin]
* OSC - for OSC profiles, used with link:oscplugin.html[OSC plugin]
* HID - for HID profiles, used with link:hidplugin.html[HID plugin]
* DMX - generic DMX profiles
* ENTTEC - ENTTEC Wing profiles, used with Enttec Wing plugin

So far, the only difference is that MIDI profiles show MIDI message
parameters in the channel editor.

*Now click the [.underline]#Channels# tab to edit the profile's
channels.* You have two choices for adding channel definitions:
[.underline]#Manual# and [.underline]#Automatic#:

'''''

==== Manual mode

image:../icons/edit_add.png[../icons/edit_add] Click the add button to
enter individual channel information by hand for each channel. +
image:../icons/edit_remove.png[../icons/edit_remove] Click to remove an
existing channel +

==== Automatic mode

image:../icons/wizard.png[../icons/wizard] Click the automatic wizard
button to attempt automatic channel detection. You'll receive further
instructions from QLC+. You must have an
link:howto-input-output-mapping.html[input plugin] assigned to the
current universe for this feature to work. Also, you must first stop the
wizard to be able to navigate away from this dialog page.

'''''

==== Channel properties

When you add image:../icons/edit_add.png[../icons/edit_add] or edit
image:../icons/edit.png[../icons/edit] a channel, a small window will be
displayed, asking you to fill or change some parameters:

* *Number*: The channel number. Since QLC+ supports a wide variety of
input plugins, the channel number might not be intuitive, so only edit
this if you know what you're doing.
* *Name*: The channel name. This is an arbitrary string to indicate the
purpose of a channel.
* *Type*: The channel type. This can be:
image:../icons/slider.png[../icons/slider] Slider,
image:../icons/knob.png[../icons/knob] Knob,
image:../icons/button.png[../icons/button] Button or
image:../icons/knob.png[../icons/knob] Encoder +
Other types: image:../icons/back.png[../icons/back] Previous page,
image:../icons/forward.png[../icons/forward] Next Page,
image:../icons/star.png[../icons/star] Set Page are used to control
multipage frames.

For MIDI profiles the dialog contains additional fields:

* Channel
* Message
* Param
* Note

where you can enter the channel specification (which translates to
channel number) in a more intuitive way.

 +
*Note that you cannot add the same channel multiple times to one
profile.*

==== image:../icons/slider.png[../icons/slider] Sliders movement properties

If your input profile includes slider channels, when you click on them
you'll notice some extra properties showing up at the bottom of the
input profile editor main window. With those, you can set how values
received from a slider should act within QLC+. +
 +
There are two behaviours: [.underline]#Absolute# and
[.underline]#Relative#. +
 +
*Absolute* is the default setting and basically tells QLC+ to use the
slider values exactly as they are received from an external
controller. +
 +
*Relative* is a more advanced behaviour that comes handy when using a
HID Joystick with a QLC+ link:vcxypad.html[XY Pad widget] or a
link:vcslider.html[Slider widget]. Values received from an external
controller are treated as relative movement starting from the current
position of a Virtual Console widget. +
Let's make an example. Suppose you have a XY Pad in your Virtual
Console, controlling and monitoring a group of moving heads. During your
show you will have a number of scenes moving the heads pan and tilt. At
some point you want to slightly adjust the position of the heads of just
a few degrees. Here is when the relative movement kicks in. When you
move your joystick (or external slider) QLC+ will adjust the heads from
their current positions. The direction will depend directly from your
external controller. The relative movement will stop when the external
controller will return to its origin. Joysticks have a spring for
that. +
In addition to this, the Input Profile Editor Relative setting allows
you to set a *Sensitivity* parameter that will instruct QLC+ about the
strenght of your external controller movements. The higher this value
is, the slower the movements will occur. The lower, the faster.

'''''

==== image:../icons/knob.png[../icons/knob] Encoder properties

An encoder is an endless rotary control and can be treated only as a
relative control. Basically the encoder can start at any position and
when turned clockwise or counter-clockwise it will generate positive or
negative offsets inside QLC+. When an Input Profile channel is set to
the Encoder type, it is possible to specify a *sensitivity* value, which
is nothing but the relative offset that will be added to or subtracted
from the current QLC+ channel value.

'''''

==== image:../icons/button.png[../icons/button] Button properties

It is possible to change the behaviour of individual buttons from an
input profile, and the following properties will be used globally in
QLC+. +
 +
*Generate an extra Press/Release when toggled*: this is a quite specific
option used for example when dealing with TouchOSC or the Behringer
BCF2000. +
QLC+ toggle events are triggered when a high+low sequence is received.
This means that QLC+ expects a non zero value (typically 255) followed
by a zero value to toggle, for example, a button. +
Devices like BCF2000 or softwares like TouchOSC, instead, send just a
non zero value when activating a button, and a zero value when
deactivating it. +
When checking this option, QLC+ will generate the "missing" events to
standardize the way some controller work. So, for example, the BCF2000
will look like sending 255+0 when pressing a button, and another 255+0
when pressing it again. +
 +
*Custom feedback*: with the "Lower value" and "Upper value" boxes, it is
possible to force custom values to be sent when the selected button
sends a non-zero and a zero value. +
For example, with this option it is possible to set globally how Akai
APC devices LEDs should be colored when activated/deactivated. +
Note that this option is global in QLC+, but it can be overridden if
needed by a specific Virtual Console widget, through its configuration
page.

=== Back to the input profile definitions panel

When you're done with channels mapping, click the OK button to accept
changes and save the input profile. If you didn't enter a
manufacturer/model for the profile, you'll be prompted to enter them
before you can continue. +
Now you should see the profile you just defined in the list of available
input profiles. Remember how to assign it to the current universe?
Scroll up to [.underline]#Profile assignment# if you don't.

To remove any existing input profiles, click the
image:../icons/edit_remove.png[../icons/edit_remove] remove button. Note
that some profiles are so-called [.underline]#system profiles# and
cannot be removed unless you're the administrator.

That's all! +
Now you can start using your preferred profile. When assigining an input
channel to a QLC+ element (like Virtual Console sliders, channel groups,
etc..) you will see that your Input profile mapping will be used.

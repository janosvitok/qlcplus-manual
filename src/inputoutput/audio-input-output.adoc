== Audio Input/Output device selection

This page describes how to select an input or output audio device to be
used inside QLC+.

To access the Input/Output Manager, just click on the tab with the
image:../icons/input_output.png[../icons/input_output,width=32] icon
placed on the bottom of the QLC+ main screen. +
Select the desired universe on the left hand side of the screen and then
click the [.underline]#Audio# tab placed beside the
[.underline]#Profile# tab on the top right hand side of the screen.

The list of audio devices detected by QLC+ is displayed. Each device has
a checkbox depending on if it supports input capture or audio output
capabilities. +
The first entry of the list is always *"Default device"*, and it is
selected as input and output by default. In this way QLC+ will work in
most of the cases out of the box. +
The default device is the one that you currently use to listen to music
or to record audio with a microphone. +
 +
If in your system there are additional audio cards (PCI or USB), it is
possible to select them in this panel as the preferred QLC+ input or
output device. +
Basically an input device is used by link:audiotriggers.html[Virtual
Console Audio Triggers] while an output device is used by
link:concept.html#audio[audio functions]. +
 +
The selection of an audio input/output line should take immediate effect
in QLC+. If not you are invited to restart QLC+ to allow a complete
initialization of the internal audio engine.

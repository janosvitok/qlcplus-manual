== Input/Output Mapping Howto

This howto document tells you how to patch plugins and their
input/output lines (physical input/output devices) to QLC+'s universes.

By default QLC+ provides 4 universes but you can add/remove them as
needed. +
The input/output mapping is saved in the currently loaded project. This
allows you to port your project on another computer/OS without the need
to reconfigure it every time. +
If no project is loaded, QLC+ will keep the I/O mapping as a "fallback"
configuration.

=== Input/Output Manager

To access the Input/Output Manager, just click on the tab with the
image:../icons/input_output.png[../icons/input_output,width=32] icon
placed on the bottom of the QLC+ main screen. +
The screen is composed in this way: +

* On the left hand side there is the list of internal universes that
QLC+ can manage
* On the right hand side there is the list of devices and their mapped
inputs, outputs and feedback lines that QLC+ has detected
* On the bottom right hand side there is a panel displaying brief
information on the currently selected device

Every device has a checkbox whenever an input, output or feedback line
is available. +
Each QLC+ universe can map a single input, a single output and a single
feedback line +

Some plugins might require configuration before they can be used' so you
might not be able to see all inputs/outputs at first. The configuration
button is place next to the information panel and it is enabled if the
plugin allows any manual setting. +
The button icon is:

=== Adding/Removing universes

QLC+ supports any number of universes, depending on the CPU limit of the
device controlling them. +
On the left hand side of the Input/Output Manager there is a toolbar
where you can add/remove, name and configure universes.

universe will have a name like "Universe X", where X is a progressive
number assigned by QLC+ (and also the Universe ID).

|image:../icons/edit_remove.png[../icons/edit_remove] |Remove the
currently selected universe. +
*Please be careful with this operation as it can compromise your project
and cannot be reverted.* +
When deleting a universe, if it is currently patched or some fixtures
are mapped on it, a popup message will appear asking for confirmation if
the operation should be completed or abandoned.

=== Patching

To patch a plugin's input/output line to the selected universe, you need
to place a checkmark on that particular plugin's input/output line. You
can have only one line assigned to a universe at a time, so when you
check another line, the checkmark will [.underline]#move# from its
previous position to the one you just checked. +
If you don't see any line on a plugin, it means you don't have any
device that QLC+ understands and you're left with the one and only
(non-selectable) choice: [.underline]#None#.

When an input/output line is checked, the corresponding universe
information on the left hand side of the screen will change and will
display the new configuration set. +
The plugin information on the bottom right hand side of the screen will
change as well and will give you the new status of the plugin line.

[[passthrough]]
=== Universe Passthrough

When passthrough is enabled, universe just forwards what it receives in
its input line to its output line. This is useful for several things:

* *Protocol converter*: when you want to use QLC+ to act as a "protocol"
converter. For example you can use this feature to transparently map an
ArtNet network to a DMX USB adapter or even MIDI.
* *Monitor external data*: patch fixtures and watch the data in DMX
monitor
* *Merge data from external controller*: Have external lighting desk
control some of the channels independently (for example conventionals)
and QLC+ control intelligent lights on the same universe.
* *Raspberry Pi*: forward data from QLC+ on PC while programming scenes;
when the workspace is transferred, Raspberry becomes main controller;
the devices are always connected to RPi

Passthrough data is not affected by QLC+ grandmaster or channel
modifiers. It is merged in HTP fashion with QLC+ output if there are any
fixtures patched at that channel (Note: it does not use LTP/HTP channel
settings). Blackout affects passthrough data.

[[input-and-feedback]]
=== Input and Feedbacks

When a plugin input line is checked, it gets enabled right away, so you
can perform a basic test to double check if your hardware is working
properly with QLC+. +
Just move a fader/knob on your external device, and if everything works
fine, you will see a image:../icons/input.png[../icons/input,width=32]
icon appearing beside the corresponding universe on the left side of the
screen.

If your input device supports a return channel, QLC+ can send a
visual/mechanical feedback to it. Devices such as Behringer BCF2000
support this feature. +
At the moment feedbacks are supported only through MIDI, OSC and
loopback.

QLC+, please continue your reading with the

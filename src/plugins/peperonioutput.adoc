=== Peperoni output plugin

==== Introduction

The Peperoni Output plugin supports USB-DMX output devices produced by
http://www.peperoni-light.de/products1.htm[Peperoni Light].

==== Requirements

===== Linux

On all Linux distributions, you need to install libusb. If you install
QLC+ with the Ubuntu Software Center or some other automatic installer
tool, this library will be installed automatically for you.

===== Mac OS X

Nothing special is needed for Mac OS X. All required components are
already inside the Q Light Controller Plus application bundle because
QLC+ uses the OS X native USB interface.

===== Windows

You must install the
http://www.lighting-solutions.de/support/driver.html[Peperoni USBDMX
Windows drivers]. Usually these come on a CD along with the Peperoni
device you've bought. +
If after installing the driver, QLC+ still doesn't detect your Peperoni
device, copy the usbdmx.dll file you find inside the driver ZIP package
(i386 folder) into the main QLC+ folder.

* Unzip the driver package to a folder on your hard disk.
* Plug the peperoni device to a USB port.
* If you're running a 32bit version of Windows, point the "Found new
hardware" wizard to look for the driver under *windows/i386*.
* If you're running a 64bit version of Windows, point the "Found new
hardware" wizard to look for the driver under *windows/ia64* or
*windows/amd64*.

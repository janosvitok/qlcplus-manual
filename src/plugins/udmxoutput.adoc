=== uDMX output plugin

==== Introduction

The uDMX Output plugin supports the
https://www.anyma.ch/research/udmx/[Anyma uDMX] USB-DMX interface on
Linux and macOS.

==== Requirements

===== Linux

On all Linux distributions, you need to install libusb. If you install
QLC+ with the Ubuntu Software Center or some other automatic installer
tool, this library will be installed automatically for you.

===== macOS

On Apple macOS, you don't need any drivers at all since QLC+ uses the
macOS native USB interface.

===== Windows

This device is not yet supported on Windows.

==== Tuning

It is possible to change the DMX frame frequency for all uDMX devices
with a hidden settings key on each platform. The key tells QLC+ how many
times each DMX frame (512 channels) should be sent to the universe per
second. A value of "30" means 30 times per second (30Hz). Please refer

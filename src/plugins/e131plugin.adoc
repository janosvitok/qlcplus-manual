=== E1.31 input/output plugin

==== Introduction

QLC+ supports the https://www.opendmx.net/index.php/E1.31[E1.31
protocol] (also known as sACN) through an input/output plugin that
receives and transmits packets on the network. +
No extra requirements are needed, since QLC+ has a native implementation
of the E1.31 protocol that works on Linux, Windows and OSX systems. +
The E1.31 plugin can send and receive packets from multiple network
cards, virtual addresses, the loopback device (127.0.0.1) and multiple
universes per network interface. +
By default, E1.31 packets will be sent as UDP on multicast addresses
like 239.255.0.x, where 'x' is the universe number selected in QLC+. The
port used is 5568. +
When using the loopback device packets are always transmitted using
address 127.0.0.1. +
When transmitting multiple universes on the same interface, the packets
will be sent by default with an E1.31 Universe ID equal to the QLC+
universe. +
 +
For example: +
QLC+ Universe 1 --> E1.31 Universe 1 on 239.255.0.1 +
QLC+ Universe 2 --> E1.31 Universe 2 on 239.255.0.2 +
... +
QLC+ Universe 8 --> E1.31 Universe 8 on 239.255.0.8 +
 +
If the above settings don't meet the requirements of your network,
please read the following chapter.

==== Configuration

When clicking on the
image:../icons/configure.png[../icons/configure,width=32] configuration
button, a small dialog will be displayed, showing the Universes
Configuration panel. +
 +
[.underline]#After# a QLC+ universe is patched with an E1.31 input or
output, an entry will be displayed in this list, allowing to manually
configure the desired parameters to be used by the E1.31 plugin. +
Input lines can be configured with the following parameters: +

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|*Multicast* |This checkbox enables you to select between multicast
input and unicast input. +
When checked, this universe will received packets from the chosen
multicast group on this interface. +
When unchecked, this universe will receive unicast packets on this IP
address only. +
Selecting Unicast input will allow selecting a different input Port.

|*IP Address* |This is the input IP address the E1.31 plugin will listen
to on the selected interface, for this QLC+ universe. +
When the input is set to multicast, you can select the multicast IP from
239.255.0.1 to 239.255.0.255. +
When the input is set to unicast, the IP address is locked on the IP
address of the selected interface.

|*Port* |This is the input port the E1.31 plugin will listen to for this
QLC+ universe. +
When the input is set to multicast, the port is locked on the default
E1.31 multicast port: 5568 +
When the input is set to unicast, you can select any port you want.

|*E1.31 Universe* |This is the input E1.31 universe the plugin will
accept for this QLC+ universe. +
This allows mapping any E1.31 universe to any QLC+ universe.

[.underline]#Input configuration example:# +
image:../images/e131_configuration.png[../images/e131_configuration] +
In this example, when receiving E1.31 packets on the address 127.0.0.1
and port 8000, the packets operating on E1.31 universe 4 will affect
QLC+ universe 1. +
Also we're transmitting QLC+ universe 2 on the multicast address
239.255.0.2, E1.31 universe 1, and QLC+ universe 3 on the unicast
address 13.0.0.175 port 7000, E1.31 universe 2. +
 +
Output lines can be configured with the following parameters: +

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|*Multicast* |This checkbox enables you to select between multicast
output and unicast output. +
When checked, this universe will send packets to the chosen multicast
group on this interface. +
When unchecked, this universe will send unicast packets to the chosen
unicast IP address. +
Selecting Unicast output will also allow you to select the outgoing
port.

|*IP Address* |This is the destination IP address where the E1.31 plugin
will transmit packets to. +
By default a multicast address is used as described above. +
When the output is set to multicast, you can set this parameter within
the range 1-255. +
This allows sending packets to the multicast range 239.255.0.1 to
239.255.0.255. +
When the output is set to unicast, you can select any arbitrary IP
address. +
When patching a QLC+ universe to the loopback device (127.0.0.1),
unicast packets will be always transmitted to 127.0.0.1.

|*Port* |This is the port the outgoing packets will target. +
Multicast E1.31 port is always 5568. +
When the output is set to unicast, you can select any port you want.

|*E1.31 Universe* |This is the E1.31 universe that will be actually
written in every packet transmitted. +
By setting this parameter, you can use any QLC+ universe to transmit to
the desired E1.31 universe.

|*Transmission Mode* |Here you can select if QLC+ should transmit full
or partial universes. +
'Full' means that all the 512 DMX channels of a universe are transmitted
at the speed rate of the QLC+ internal clock (50Hz), producing a fixed
bitrate of about 200Kbit/s. +
'Partial', instead, means that QLC+ will transmit only the DMX channel
actually used in a universe, starting from channel 1. For example if you
raise channel 3 of a fixture with address 50, the E1.31 plugin will
transmit only 53 DMX channels, thus limiting the trasnmission bitrate. +
Use this setting only if the receiving E1.31 node supports partial
transmission.

|*Priority* |E1.31 source priority. +
*0* is the minimum priority, *200* is the maximum, *100* is default
priority. +
When E1.31 receiver gets data for a particular universe from multiple
sources, it uses data from source with the highest priority. +
This allows various failover schemes. Note that QLC+ does not yet
acknowledge priority on input.

 +
Settings that are different from the plugin defaults, will be stored in
your QLC+ workspace, to increase the portability of a project across
different platforms, such as different operating systems or a PC and a
Raspberry Pi.

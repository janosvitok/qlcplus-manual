=== OLA output plugin

==== Introduction

The OLA plugin allows direct communication between QLC+ and the
https://www.opendmx.net/index.php/Open_Lighting_Architecture[OLA
framework] on the same machine.

==== Requirements

The OLA plugin requires OLA to be installed on the system. +
Since OLA doesn't run on Windows, only Linux and macOS users can benefit
from this plugin. +
Information on how to download and install OLA can be found
https://opendmx.net/index.php/Download_%26_Install_OLA[here]. +
QLC+ needs the OLA server to be running to be able to communicate with
the OLA framework. This can be done either manually by starting up
"olad" from a terminal or in the configuration panel by ticking "Run
standalone OLA daemon".

==== Configuration

When pressing the configuration button over a OLA output line, a small
popup window will appear showing the basic information of how QLC+
outputs are mapped against OLA universes. +
On the bottom, a check button will allow you to force the OLA server
startup.

==== OLA Setup

When you have made sure that everything is working in QLC+ and have
checked how the universes are mapped, you can setup OLA to output the
signal received from QLC+ to a DMX device, either USB or over the
network. +
Here's an https://www.opendmx.net/index.php/Using_OLA[introduction of
OLA usage]. +
Basically you need to open a web browser, connect to
http://localhost:9090 or http://127.0.0.1:9090 and add a universe that
has the same number mapped in QLC+ and select the desired output line.

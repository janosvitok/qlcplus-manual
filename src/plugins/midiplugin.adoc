=== MIDI input/output plugin

==== Introduction

This plugin gives input/output support for the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI[MIDI protocol] and gives the user
freedom to control typical parameters like channels, Notes, Program
Change and Control Change. +
The MIDI plugin can be quite powerful used in combination with MIDI
devices such as keyboards, MIDI controllers (like Behringer BCF2000 or
KORG nanoKONTROL) or a software audio sequencer like Cubase or Ardour
3. +
The usage can vary from fader-to-fader control (the BCF2000 case) to
sequence triggering for synchronized shows (metronome controlled gigs
using an audio sequencer)

==== Configuration

When you click on the configuration button
image:../icons/configure.png[../icons/configure] a window will appear,
showing all the MIDI input and output lines detected. +
Each line has three options that can be changed depending on your needs:

* *MIDI Channel*: This is the channel where QLC+ will receive or send
data through the MIDI system. MIDI channels can go from 1 to 16. The
special "1-16" channel will tell QLC+ to receive or send data on any
MIDI channel.
* *Mode*: This is the MIDI mode that QLC+ will use to send data through
the MIDI system. This parameter can assume three possible values:
** *Note velocity*: in this mode, QLC+ will send data using MIDI notes
velocity. MIDI notes can go from 21 (A0) to 108 (C8) and each note can
have a velocity going from 0 to 127, which will be doubled inside QLC+
to match the DMX range (0-255).
** *Control Change*: this is one of the MIDI protocol messages (like
Program Change) frequently used by MIDI controllers. Each device should
list the supported CC messages in its user manual, so please consult it
before using this mode. The CC range can go from 0 to 127 and can have
values from 0 to 127, which will be doubled inside QLC+ to match the DMX
range (0-255).
** *Program Change*: this is one of the MIDI protocol messages (like
Control Change) frequently used by MIDI controllers. Each device should
list the supported PC messages in its user manual, so please consult it
before using this mode. The PC range can go from 0 to 127 and can have
values from 0 to 127, which will be doubled inside QLC+ to match the DMX
range (0-255).
* *Initialization message*: This is a list of presets (templates)
containing the intialization message that QLC+ will send when opening a
MIDI device before using it. A detailed explanation of this
functionality is written below.

==== Feedbacks

The MIDI plugin is one of the QLC+ plugins supporting feedbacks. When
QLC+ detects a MIDI device with an output line, it will enable the
feedback check box in the
link:howto-input-output-mapping.html[Input/Output panel]. Please note
that output and feedback are exclusive, so they cannot both be used at
the same time. +
If your MIDI device supports a return channel, QLC+ can send a
visual/mechanical feedback to it. Devices such as the Behringer BCF2000
support this feature. This is very useful during live shows to have
immediate knowledge of the current state of faders mapped in QLC+. +
 +
A small trick that can be achieved with QLC+ is to use feedback as a
generic MIDI output line to trigger external controllers/sequencers. +
Let's look at some examples:

* Input: *OSC* ---> Output: *DMX USB* --> Feedback: *MIDI*
* Input: *Enttec Wing* --> Output: *ArtNet* --> Feedback: *MIDI*

[[korg-nanopad]]
==== KORG nanoPAD X Axis

For unknown reasons, the nanoPAD factory defaults don't map the X Axis
of the pad area. To have it fully working with QLC+, please download the
KORG utility (Windows and macOS only) from
http://i.korg.com/SupportPage.aspx?productid=415[here] and set the X
Axis to CC2 (Control Change #2).

[[akai-feedbacks]]
==== AKAI APC LED Feedbacks

When using one of the Akai APC family controller, there is one feature
that could come very handy: LED color feedbacks. +
The default behaviour with Virtual Console buttons is: value = 0: LED
off, value = 255: LED green +
This can be customized when selecting an input channel, by pressing the
"Custom feedback" button. +
A new area is displayed, showing the possibility to enter a lower and an
upper value. This is basically translated in which values QLC+ should
send for buttons on/off states. +
Since the MIDI protocol works in a range of 0-127 values, and QLC+ works
in the DMX range of 0-255, the following table points you directly to
the values you should enter to obtain the desired color of an APC LED.
Basically they are taken from APC manuals and doubled.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Value |LED color
|0 |Off
|2 |Green
|4 |Green Blinking
|6 |Red
|8 |Red Blinking
|10 |Yellow
|12 |Yellow Blinking
|14-255 |Green
|===

It's interesting to notice that you don't necessarily need to keep 0 as
lower value. For example with lower = 6 and upper = 2 the result will
be: Function Off -> red LED, Function On -> green LED.

==== MIDI beat clock

Starting from version 4.5.0, QLC+ supports the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_beat_clock[MIDI beat clock] +
Not to be confused with the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_timecode[MIDI timecode], the MIDI
beat clock is a useful signal to sync BPM-based devices such as a drum
machine with your lights controlled by QLC+. +
Two special MIDI channels have been mapped in QLC+ to control your
link:virtualconsole.html[Virtual Console] widgets with a beat clock. +
Here's a brief explanation of the special channels:

* *Channel 530*: A signal is sent on this channel when a beat clock
starts or stops.
* *Channel 531*: This signal is sent every BPM. QLC+ doesn't take any
notice of measures (e.g. 3/4, 4/4, 7/8), so when setting up your MIDI
clock you need to consider how QLC+ will handle it.

 +
*Hint*: If your controller is set to work at high BPM (e.g. 180-200),
you might find difficult to catch the start signal. One trick for doing
this is to catch the stop signal. Example: +

. Enable the QLC+ Virtual Console widget auto-detection
. Hit play on your device generating the MIDI beat clock. QLC+ will
detect channel 530 and will switch very quickly to 531
. Stop the playback on your MIDI beat clock device. QLC+ will detect
channel 530 again.
. Disable the QLC+ Virtual Console widget auto-detection

In a similar way you can catch the beat signal as well. Just disable the
auto-detection process before stopping the playback on your beat
controller (invert steps 3 and 4).

[[midi-template]]
==== MIDI initialization message

There might be cases where your MIDI device needs some commands to turn
into a specific operating mode +
The MIDI protocol can handle this through SysEx. These are particular
messages to instruct a MIDI device how to behave. +
QLC+ can use a XML template to achieve this that can be selected in the
MIDI configuration panel. +
Here's an example of how a template looks like: +

....
<!DOCTYPE MidiTemplate>
<MidiTemplate>
 <Creator>
  <Author>Your name</Author>
 </Creator>
 <Description>A brief description of what the template does.</Description>
 <Name>Template name to be displayed by QLC+</Name>
 <InitMessage>F0 47 00 7B 60 00 04 41 09 00 05 F7</InitMessage>
</MidiTemplate>
....

You can create the ones you need and place them in your MidiTemplates
folder. +
You are welcome to submit them in the QLC+ forum.

To handle a mix of various MIDI messages (Notes, PC, CC, etc..), QLC+
remaps them into a sequential order. +

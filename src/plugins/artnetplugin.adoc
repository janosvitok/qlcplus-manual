=== ArtNet input/output plugin

==== Introduction

QLC+ supports the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art-Net[ArtNet protocol]
through an input/output plugin that receives and transmits packets on
the network. +
No extra requirements are needed, since QLC+ has a native implementation
of the ArtNet protocol that works on Linux, Windows and macOS systems. +
The ArtNet plugin can send and receive packets from multiple network
cards, virtual addresses, the loopback device (127.0.0.1) and multiple
universes per network interface. +
By default, ArtNet packets are transmitted as UDP, using the default
port 6454 and the broadcast address of the selected inteface (e.g.
192.168.0.255). When using the loopback device packets are always
transmitted using address 127.0.0.1. +
When transmitting multiple universes on the same interface, the packets
will be sent by default with an ArtNet Universe ID equal to the QLC+
universe number minus 1. +
 +
For example: +
QLC+ Universe 1 --> ArtNet Universe 0 +
QLC+ Universe 2 --> ArtNet Universe 1 +
... +
QLC+ Universe 8 --> ArtNet Universe 7 +
 +
This choice is due to some facts: +
1- The first valid ArtNet universe is 0 and not 1 +
2- The first universe accepted by commercial ArtNet-DMX devices like
eDMX and ODE is 0, so to have QLC+ to work out of the box, the first
ArtNet universe must be 0. +
 +
If the above settings don't meet the requirements of your network,
please read the following chapter.

==== Configuration

When clicking on the
image:../icons/configure.png[../icons/configure,width=32] configuration
button, a small dialog will be displayed, showing 2 tabs: the Universes
Configuration and the Nodes Tree. +
 +
*Universes Configuration*: [.underline]#after# a QLC+ universe is
patched with an ArtNet input or output, an entry will be displayed in
this list, allowing to manually configure the desired parameters to be
used by the ArtNet plugin. +
Input lines do not have particular parameters, while an output line can
be configured wth the following: +

* *IP Address*: This is the destination IP address where the ArtNet
plugin will transmit packets to. By default a broadcast address is used
(so ending with .255) and by setting this in the 1-254 range, ArtNet
will transmit a QLC+ universe in unicast mode. If your ArtNet network
uses a simple hub, the output IP address is irrelevant, as broadcast or
unicast doesn't make any difference. However, if you use a network
switch, unicast is fundamental to balance the network congestion, as
every port of the switch is associated to a network IP and will receive
only the packets with its destination IP. +
*Note*: Do not set the output IP address with the same IP address of
your transmitting node (e.g. the PC where QLC+ is running) as it is just
wrong and can cause a network loop. If you need to communicate with an
ArtNet node running in the same machine where QLC+ is running, use the
loopback device instead (127.0.0.1).
* *ArtNet Universe*: This is the ArtNet universe that will be actually
written in every packet transmitted. By setting this parameter, you can
use any QLC+ universe to transmit to the desired ArtNet universe.
* *Transmission Mode*: Here you can select if QLC+ should transmit full
or partial universes. +
'Full' means that all the 512 DMX channels of a universe are transmitted
at the speed rate of the QLC+ internal clock (50Hz), producing a fixed
bitrate of about 200Kbit/s. +
'Partial', instead, means that QLC+ will transmit only the DMX channel
actually used in a universe, starting from channel 1. For example if you
raise channel 3 of a fixture with address 50, the ArtNet plugin will
transmit only 53 DMX channels, thus limiting the trasnmission bitrate.
Use this setting only if the receiving ArtNet node supports partial
transmission.

Settings that are different from the plugin defaults, will be stored in
your QLC+ workspace, to increase the portability of a project across
different platforms, such as different operating systems or a PC and a
Raspberry Pi. +
 +
*Nodes Tree*: This tab displays the ArtNet nodes discovered on the
network, grouped by network interface. +
QLC+ will always appear in this list as a node participating to the
network. +
ArtNet nodes are added to this list if they support the
ArtPoll/ArtPollReply message, otherwise they won't appear. This doesn't
mean you will not able to communicate with them.

==== DMXKing eDMX and ENTTEC ODE

If you own one of these devices, they both have configuration tools that
might come handy when working with QLC+. With them you can set several
parameters to match the best configuration to input/output data from/to
QLC+. +
For example if you want QLC+ universe 3 to output data on the first port
of a eDMX, you need to use the tool below to change the device universe
address to 2. +

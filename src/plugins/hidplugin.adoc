=== HID plugin

==== Introduction

The HID plugin supports the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device[HID system] on
Windows and Linux. +
HID is a generic way of mapping input/output devices such as joysticks,
touchpads, keyboards, mice, etc. +
The QLC+ HID plugin aims to support only joysticks and the FX5 USB DMX
adapter.

==== Requirements

No special requirement is needed for this plugin. Just make sure your
operating system is actually recognizing the device you're going to use.
On Linux you might need some kernel modules (normally provided by modern
distributions) and on Windows a driver provided by the device
manufacturer.

==== Joysticks

QLC+ tries to detect the specific joystick functionalities, such as axes
and buttons, as individual channels that can be mapped to your Virtual
Console widgets. +
Axes and buttons are mapped by QLC+ in sequential order, so for example
if your joystick supports 2 axes and 4 buttons, they will appear in the
input mapping dialogs like this: +

* channel 1: X-axis
* channel 2: Y-axis
* channel 3: Button 1
* channel 4: Button 2
* channel 5: Button 3
* channel 6: Button 4

==== FX5 USB DMX

The https://fx5.de/[FX5 USB DMX] adapter is supported either for output
and input DMX data. Check the product manual for the connection and
peculiar issues.

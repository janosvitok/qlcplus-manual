=== OS2L plugin

==== Introduction

The OS2L plugin allows direct communication between QLC+ and an OS2L
capable host. +
OS2L specifications can be found at: http://os2l.org/[http://os2l.org] +
At the moment the only OS2L host supported is
https://www.virtualdj.com/[Virtual DJ]. +
QLC+ OS2L plugin will work either on the same host (127.0.0.1) or on a
different host with an OS of your choice (Windows, macOS, Linux)

==== Configuration - Virtual DJ

First and foremost, you need to tell VDJ where to send OS2L messages. +
Open VDJ settings, go to the 'Options' panel and type 'os2l' in the top
search box. +
Modify the 'os2lDirectIp' field by setting the IP:port where VDJ can
reach QLC+. For example, '127.0.0.1:9996' should work if QLC+ runs on
the same (Windows) PC of VDJ. +
Once done, restart VDJ. +
 +
Now go to QLC+, enable the OS2L plugin on any universe. If you have set
a specific port in VDJ, open the OS2L configuration dialog and set the
same port there. +
Once done, QLC+ will start receiving signals from VDJ (joystick icon
will blink beside the Universe box)

=== Select Function(s)

Whenever a link:concept.html#Functions[Function] needs to be selected,
for example when you're adding steps to a
link:concept.html#Chaser[Chaser], using the
link:chasereditor.html[Chaser Editor], the *Select Function* dialog is
used.

Sometimes the destination that you are selecting the function for might
allow the selection of multiple functions, for example, when adding
steps to a Chaser or functions to a Collection. In these cases, the
order in which the functions are selected will also be the order in
which they are added to their destination. On the other hand, when
attaching a function to a button in the link:virtualconsole.html[Virtual
Console], you may select only one function at a time.

Refer to your operating system manual for documentation on how to select
multiple items in a list.

|*Functions to display* |There are two radio buttons on the top of the
window: *All functions* and *Running functions*. +
By clicking on them, the list below will be filled only with the desired
functions. +
For example, when performing a link:liveedit.html[Live edit], you might
want to display only the running functions. +
Obviously, in design mode, selecting "Running functions" will show an
empty list.

|*Function list* a|
* Name: The names of available functions
* Type: The type of each of the available functions

|*Filter* a|
You can filter the function list so that only those function *types*
that have been checked are shown. Filtering is especially useful if you
have lots of functions to select from.

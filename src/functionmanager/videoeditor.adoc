functions. +

|===
|image:../icons/player_play.png[../icons/player_play] |Start/stop the
video playback. If the file doesn't exist or an invalid URL has been
entered, this button will have no effect

|*Video name* |Change the name of the Video function. By default this is
set with the file name, until it is manually changed.

|*File name* |If the attached file is local, displays the absolute path
of the video file. A local source file can be changed by clicking on the
"..." button on the right side. +
It is also possible to stream a video from the network. Just click on
the image:../icons/global.png[../icons/global] button and enter a valid
HTTP URL.

|*Duration* |Displays the video file duration in the typical QLC+ way.
For example: 04m14s.22.

|*Resolution* |Displays the resolution in pixels detected on the
attached video file. +
*Note*: since QLC+ relies on the https://www.qt.io/[Qt libraries] to
play video sources, there is a known issue for which Qt is not able to
detect the size (and codecs) of videos in Windows and Mac OSX. +
Basically a size of "0x0" will be displayed. The fullscreen video
playback will be OK though. +
On detection failure, a default size of 640x480 pixels is internally set
to allow the windowed mode to work. +
Hopefully this will be fixed by the Qt team in the future.

|*Video codec* |Displays the codec used to compress the video stream
into the attached video file.

|*Audio codec* |Displays the codec used to compress the audio stream
into the attached video file.

|*Screen* |Allows to select the output screen where the video should be
playback. This will normally displays just one choice unless multiple
video outputs (monitors, projectors) are connected to the system

|*Video Output* a|
Allows to choose how the attached video should be displayed. Possible
options are

* *Windowed*: a window with the original size of the video will be
displayed on the selected output screen.
* *Fullscreen*: The video will use the whole screen size, without
showing any window decoration (title bar, etc)

|*Playback mode* a|
Allows to choose how the attached video should be played. Possible
options are

* *Single shot*: The video will be played just once
* *Loop*: The video playback will be restarted from the beginning when
reaching the end. The loop mode will continue indefinitely until the
Video function is stopped.

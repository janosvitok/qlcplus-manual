=== RGB Matrix Editor

The RGB matrix editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit
image:../icons/rgbmatrix.png[../icons/rgbmatrix]
link:concept.html#RGBMatrix[RGB matrix] functions. The function works on
predefined image:../icons/group.png[../icons/group]
link:concept.html#FixtureGroup[Fixture Groups] created by the user with
the image:../icons/fixture.png[../icons/fixture]
link:fixturemanager.html[Fixture Manager].

==== Controls

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|*RGB matrix name* |Change the name of the RGB matrix.

|image:../icons/speed.png[../icons/speed] a|
Adjust the RGB Matrix speed settings:

*Fade In:* The time it takes for the fixtures in the RGB Matrix fixture
group to fade their intensity channels up

*Fade Out:* The time it takes for the fixtures in the RGB Matrix fixture
group to fade their intensity channels back to zero

*Duration:* The duration of each step of the selected pattern

|image:../icons/sequence.png[../icons/sequence] |Convert the current RGB
Matrix into a link:concept.html#Sequence[Sequence]. This is useful to
speed up the creation of a link:concept.html#Show[Show]. Please note
that if the selected pattern generates random data, this functionality
will generate a different Sequence every time.

|image:../icons/square.png[../icons/square] |Switch the preview mode
between circles and squares

|image:../icons/player_play.png[../icons/player_play] |Make the RGB
Matrix run as if it were started from a link:virtualconsole.html[Virtual
Console] button. Note that the preview stops while the function is
running.

|*Fixture group* |The link:concept.html#FixtureGroup[Fixture Group] that
is controlled by this RGB matrix.

|*Preview area* |Shows a preview of the currently selected pattern
imposed on the fixtures defined in the currently selected fixture group.
Note that the preview doesn't show the difference between RGB-capable
and monochrome/fixed color fixtures.

|*Pattern* a|
Select the pattern and colors that are used on the selected fixture
group for drawing graphics. +
Patterns can be:

*Plain Color*: all the pixels of the matrix will be lit to the selected
color

 +

*Animated Text*: display an animated text with the following parameters:

* The text edit field is used to edit the text content that is
scrolled/flashed on the matrix.
* The font button image:../icons/fonts.png[../icons/fonts] is used to
select the font (tip: bitmap fonts work best)
* The drop-down box is used to select the animation style (Horizontal,
Vertical or Letters)

 +

*Audio Spectrum*: QLC+ will start capturing data from the chosen audio
input device and will represent the audio spectrum as vertical bars in
the RGB Matrix with the selected start and end color. +
For an optimal usage of this pattern, the hold time of the Matrix must
be set to a reasonably low value (e.g. .20)

 +

*Image*: display an image loaded from a file, with the following
parameters:

* The text edit field is used to edit the image filename
* The image button image:../icons/image.png[../icons/image] is used to
load an image from file
* The drop-down box is used to select the animation style (Static,
Horizontal, Vertical or Animation)

Supported formats: PNG, XPM, JPG, GIF (for animated gifs only first
frame is used).

Styles:

* *Static* - the image is statically displayed on the matrix. If the
image is smaller than the matrix, it is repeated in both directions.
(Tip: for stripes, use 1-point-high images)
* *Horizontal* - the image is scrolled horizontaly. Again, image is
repeated in both directions.
* *Vertical* - same as *Horizontal*, but in vertical direction.
* *Animation* - play animation. Stack the frames (of width equal to
matrix's) side by side in one image. For example, when matrix is 8x8 and
you want to have 4 frames, make image 32x8. The image is still repeated
vertically.

 +
The rest of the pattern list is filled with
link:concept.html#RGBScript[RGB Scripts] loaded when QLC+ starts up. +
Depending on the selected pattern, it is possible to choose a start and
an end color. Some patterns do not allow colors at all (since they
elapse them autonomously) or allow just one color. +

|*Pattern Blend Mode* a|
The blend mode is the mechanism used to mix multiple RGB Matrices
running one on top of the other. +
Here's a representation of how it works:

image:../images/blending.png[../images/blending]

The matrix running on the bottom layer must use the default mode, to
prepare a ground of colors that all the above layers can use to perform
blending.

|*Pattern Color Mode* |The color mode is the mechanism select which
color channels the RGB Matrices applies to. +
Default setting is RGB mode, addressing RGB channels or CMY channels. If
set otherwise, only the selected channels (e.g. "White") whill be set in
a grayscale of the selected color(s). Channels not representing the
selected color mode (e.g. R, G and B) will not be touched.

|*Offset* a|
Available only when *Text* or *Image* is the selected pattern.

* *X:* Used to shift the pattern along the horizontal x-axis (negative
values go to the left, positive values go to the right)
* *Y:* Used to shift the pattern along the vertical y-axis (negative
values go up, positive values go down)

|*Run Order* a|
* *Loop:* Run through the steps over and over again.
* *Single Shot:* Run through the steps once and then stop.
* *Ping Pong:* Run through the steps over and over again, reversing
direction at both ends.

|*Direction* a|
* *Forward:* Run through the steps from start to end; 1, 2, 3...
* *Backward:* Run through the steps from end to start; ...3, 2, 1

|*Other Controls* a|
* *Dimmer control:* When enabled, dimmer channel of include fixtures
will be set to 100% when the matrix is running. Uncheck if you want
independent intensity control.

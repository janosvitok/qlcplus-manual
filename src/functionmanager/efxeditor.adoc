=== EFX Editor

The EFX editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit
image:../icons/efx.png[../icons/efx] link:concept.html#EFX[EFX]
functions. The view is split into two tabs:

* *General* tab is for selecting link:concept.html#Fixtures[Fixtures],
speed and fixture order.
* *Movement* tab is for selecting details on how the fixtures should
move their beams.

|===
|image:../icons/speed.png[../icons/speed] a|
Adjust the EFX speed settings:

*Fade In:* Not used currently

*Fade Out:* Not used currently

*Duration:* The duration of one full round using the selected pattern

|image:../icons/player_play.png[../icons/player_play] |Enable the output
and run the EFX to test how it looks like

|*EFX name* |Change the name of the EFX.

|*Fixture list* a|
* Step: Shows the order in which the fixtures start their movement in
serial/asymmetric order
* Fixture: The name of each fixture that has been added to the EFX
* Mode: The channels the EFX should control. They can be *Position*,
*Dimmer* or *RGB* +
Note: when selecting RGB, you might want to enable the "Color
Background" described below.
* Reverse: When checked, the fixture reverses its movement as opposed to
non-reversed fixtures. The "normal" direction is set by direction in the
"Movement" page.
* Start Offset: Value in degrees, where on the movement path this
fixture should start

|image:../icons/edit_add.png[../icons/edit_add] |Add a
link:concept.html#Fixtures[Fixture] to the EFX, after the currently
selected position. Since EFX is used for moving the head or mirror of an
intelligent fixture, only fixtures with *pan and tilt* capability (8bit
or 16bit) can be added to an EFX.

|image:../icons/edit_remove.png[../icons/edit_remove] |Remove the
selected fixtures from the EFX.

|image:../icons/up.png[../icons/up] |Raise the selected fixture upwards
(earlier) in serial order.

|image:../icons/down.png[../icons/down] |Lower the selected fixture
downwards (later) in serial order.

|*Fixture order* |Change the EFX's fixture orderâ€”see below.

[[movement-tab]]
==== Movement Tab Controls

image:../images/efx-movement.png[../images/efx-movement]

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|*Pattern area* a|
Shows a 2D-projection of the fixtures' head/mirror movement. Every time
you change a parameter, one small dot for each fixture travels the
complete path in its selected direction from its start offset.

The speed of the movement reflects selected speed settings.

|*Direction* a|
Default direction of the fixtures (can be altered individually for each
fixture by the checkbox in the *Reverse* column)

* Forward: The fixtures move forwards along the pattern path
* Backward: The fixtures move backwards along the pattern path

|*Run order* a|
* Loop: Run thru the steps over and over again.
* Single Shot: Run thru the steps once and then stop.
* Ping Pong: Run thru the steps over and over again, reversing direction
at both ends.

|*Pattern* a|
Select the movement pattern algorithm.

* Circle
* Eight
* Line: goes from one end to the other and back; faster in the middle,
slower at the ends
* Line2: goes in one direction only; speed is always the same
* Diamond
* Square
* SquareChoppy
* Leaf
* Lissajous

|*Parameters* a|
* Width: Choose the pan width (0-255)
* Height: Choose the tilt height (0-255)
* X Offset: Move the pattern's horizontal (pan) centerpoint (0-255)
* Y Offset: Move the pattern's vertical (tilt) centerpoint (0-255)
* Rotation: Rotate the pattern along its axis (0-360 degrees)
* Start Offset: Where along the path the movement should start (0-360
degrees)
* X Frequency: Change the *Lissajous* pattern's X (horizontal) frequency
(0-32)
* Y Frequency: Change the *Lissajous* pattern's Y (vertical) frequency
(0-32)
* X Phase: Change the *Lissajous* pattern's X (horizontal) phase (0-360
degrees)
* Y Phase: Change the *Lissajous* pattern's Y (vertical) phase (0-360
degrees)

|*Color Bacground* |When enabled, the EFX preview background will
display a RGB palette, to show what the EFX does when controlling RGB
channels

|*Relative* |See below.

==== Fixture Order

Fixtures taking part in an EFX function can be set to follow the
algorithm in certain order:

*Parallel:* all fixtures follow the same pattern synchronously

*Serial:* fixtures start following the pattern one after the other, with
a little delay between each of them.

*Asymmetric:* all fixtures start moving simultaneously, but with similar
offset as in the Serial mode.

==== Direction

EFX functions' direction can be reversed for all fixtures at once or on
a per-fixture basis. The function can also be set to do an infinite
loop, an infinite ping-pong-loop (direction is reversed after each pass)
or it can run through just once, in a single-shot mode, after which it
terminates by itself. If the function is set to do an infinite loop, it
must be stopped manually.

==== Relative Mode

EFX position is absolute by default-in other words, the selected EFX
will exclusively control the X/Y position of the specified heads. When
the Relative Mode checkbox is enabled, the EFX position acts as a layer
on top of any position that has already been set (e.g. by a scene or
even another EFX). In other words, the EFX is relative to current
fixture position.

In absolute mode. the EFX can be set to run at specific head position
(e. g. do circle downstage center, stage left, etc.)

In relative mode, the center of the preview window (offset x=127, offset
y=127) will be applied to current head position.

It is useful to reduce number of EFX presets: let's say we want to have
3 types of EFX (pan saw, tilt saw, circle) at 4 places (e.g. 4 stage
corners). In absolute mode that means 3x4 = 12 presets. If we want to
change something, we have to edit many functions. We most probably need
also one VC button for each. In relative mode, we create one EFX preset
for each EFX type (pan saw, tilt saw, circle), and we set offset to
neutral (x=127, y=127). Then, we create scenes with PAN & TILT channels
for each position. Now we have only 3+4 presets (and 3+4 VC buttons,
preferably in 2 solo frames).

*Tips&Tricks*

In relative mode, it is also possible to fade between positions (set
fade time in scenes) while the EFX is running.

Using XYPad and relative mode, it is possible to move EFX to any place
during the show.

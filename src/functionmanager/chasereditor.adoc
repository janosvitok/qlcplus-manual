=== Chaser Editor

The chaser editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit
image:../icons/chaser.png[../icons/chaser]
link:concept.html#Chaser[Chaser] functions. +
A Chaser is composed by steps and each step is represented by

* A progressive number
* The related function name
* Fade in time
* Hold time
* Fade out time
* Step total duration time
* A note field in case you need to write something to remember what the
step does

The timings steps and the note field can be modified by double clicking
on them. By default the times are taken in seconds (for example 135
means 2m15s), unless you use the same syntax QLC+ uses (for example
1m12s.80)

can be modified manually and doesn't necessarily affect all scenes.

*Run Order*

* Loop: Run through the steps over and over again.
* Single Shot: Run through the steps once and then stop.
* Ping Pong: Run through the steps over and over again, reversing
direction at both ends.
* Random: Run through the steps over and over again in random order.

*Direction*

* Forward: Run through the steps from start to end; 1, 2, 3...
* Backward: Run through the steps from end to start; ...3, 2, 1

=== Collection Editor

The collection editor, as its name suggests, is used to edit

link:concept.html#Collection[Collection] functions. +
Collections are very helpful in a workflow where you create QLC+
functions dedicated to specific areas of your show. For example, you can
create a number of Scenes to control only colors, some other Scenes to
control only positions and so on. Then you can create a number of
Chasers and EFX for automations. +
When you have created all the basic elements of your show, you can then
use Collections to build a sort of "shortcut" to compound scenes. For
example a color Scene + a position Scene.

*Note:* Collections don't have speed setting; each function you include
in a collection follows its own speed settings.

*Important*: The order of the Functions in a Collection is fundamental
when dealing with HTP/LTP usage or relative values. QLC+ will internally
start the Functions of a Collection from the first to the last, so if
they use the same channels, just keep this in mind because you might run
into undesired effects. +
For example a Scene setting Pan/Tilt channels + a EFX in relative mode
must have a precise order: the Scene in the first position and the EFX
in the second position.

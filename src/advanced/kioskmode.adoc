=== Kiosk Mode

QLC+ has a special mode when your lighting needs to be operated by
inexperienced people, or you just want to prevent unwanted changes. It's
called the Kiosk mode. In this mode only the Virtual Console is
displayed, so no editing is possible.

When you want to start QLC+ in kiosk mode, run:

____
`+qlcplus -k -f -o workspace.qxw -p -c 500,10,32,32+`
____

* *-k* enables the kiosk mode
* *-f* puts QLC+ in fullscreen mode
* *-o workspace.qxw* opens specified workspace
* *-p* starts operate mode
* *-c 500,10,32,32* creates a close button with size of 32x32 pixels,
500 pixels from left and 10 pixels from top.

You can of course specify your own workspace file for *-o*, and
size/position for *-c*.

You can omit any of the paramteres if you need to - for example, omit
*-c 500,10,32,32* if you don't want close button, and omit *-f* if you
don't want fullscreen.

All command-line parameters are described

=== GUI style customization

Starting from version 4.5.0, QLC+ can read a user custom file to change
the GUI appearance in a very accessible way. +
If no file is found, QLC+ will start with the default style.

==== The GUI style file

The file name is hardcoded into QLC+ and must be: `+qlcplusStyle.qss+` +
The style file must also be placed in a specific path which is: +

* *Linux*: $HOME/.qlcplus
* *Windows*: Your user folder/QLC+
* *OSX*: Library/Application Support/QLC+

The style file must have a CSS syntax. If you're comfortable with web
designing, you should find the creation of this file very easy! +
Since the style file is strictly related to the inner Qt objects, you
might want to read the following articles to find out the elements'
names and the additional CSS properties the Qt team added to the default
CSS syntax. +

Sheets Examples] +
It is up to your imagination how you prefer to customize the QLC+ GUI
appearance! If you find a style worth sharing, don't forget to send in
your contribution by posting it online in the

==== QLC+ dark blue style example

Just to give you an example of how easy this process is, here's a
blue-ish dark style for QLC+. +
If you copy the following lines into `+qlcplusStyle.qss+` in the right
location as explained above, you will see it immediately applied to
QLC+.

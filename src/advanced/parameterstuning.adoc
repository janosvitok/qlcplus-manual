=== Parameters tuning

This section explains how to manually get at and tune some QLC+
parameters not available from the UI. +
Keep in mind that if you cannot change them from the UI, it means there
is a good reason for it.

WARNING: DO NOT edit the configuration files manually unless you know what you're doing. Any misplaced change can cause program crashes or awkward instability.

[[location]]
==== QLC+ configuration location

===== Linux

Configuration files are located in your user $HOME directory, in the
.config/qlcplus folder. +
Here's the quick command to access it from a terminal: +
`+cd $HOME/.config/qlcplus+` +
You will find both QLC+ and Fixture editor configuration files.

===== Windows

Configuration parameters are stored in the Windows registry. +
To access it, run the "regedit" tool and search for the key named
"qlcplus". +

===== Mac OSX

Configuration files are located in your user $HOME directory, in the
Library/Preferences folder, which is by default hidden by OSX. +
Here's the quick command to access it from a terminal: +
`+cd $HOME/Library/Preferences+` +
The QLC+ configuration file is called
`+net.sf.Q Light Controller Plus.plist+` while the Fixture editor
configuration file is called
`+net.sf.Fixture Definition Editor.plist+`. +
 +
*Please note that preferences are cached!* Basically OSX loads all the
plist files in memory at boot, and if you change them manually it will
ignore the changes. Even worse, periodically it refreshes the files, so
it overwrites your changes. +
The solution is, after changing a .plist file, open a terminal and type
this: +
`+killall -u yourusername cfprefsd+` +
Where `+yourusername+` is the name of the user you use to access your
Mac. The command forces OSX to reload the preferences, including your
changes.

[[reset]]
==== Configuration Reset

Sometimes it might be necessary to reset the QLC+ configuration and
bring QLC+ to a "Factory defaults" state. +
To do so, locate the configuration as explained in the first paragraph,
then do the following:

* On Linux and OSX use the `+rm 'filename'+` command to delete the
configuration file
* On Windows delete the whole 'qlcplus' KEY using regedit

[[syntax]]
==== Parameters syntax

Due to Qt differences on different platforms, parameters are stored in
different ways depending on your Operating System.

===== Linux

Parameters are stored in a plain text file that you can modify with a
plain text editor like gedit, kwrite, kate, nano, vim or similar. They
are presented as follows:

....
    [category]
    name=value
....

===== Windows

Parameters are stored in the Windows registry and can be modified with
the regedit tool included in every Windows version. They are presented
as follows:

....
    "category" is displayed as a folder
    "parameter" is contained in "category" and is represented as a key. It is most likely that all QLC+ keys are an integer type.
    "value" is the actual value of "parameter"
....

===== Mac OSX

Parameters are stored in a plain text file that you can modify with a
plain text editor like
https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/[TextWrangler] or
similar. They are presented as follows:

....
    <key>category.name</key>
    <string>value</string>
    or
    <integer>42</integer>
....

[[list]]
==== Parameters list

Most likely you will not find the following parameters in a standard
QLC+ configuration. To make them effective, you need to *add* them at
the end of your configuration file.

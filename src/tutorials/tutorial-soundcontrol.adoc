=== Sound Control Tutorial

This tutorial covers how to set up sound control for chasers.

==== The steps

. In image:../icons/function.png[../icons/function]Function Manager,
create image:../icons/chaser.png[../icons/chaser]
link:concept.html#Chaser[Chaser], set steps to have infinite hold time
. In the
image:../icons/virtualconsole.png[../icons/virtualconsole]Virtual
Console, create
image:../icons/cuelist.png[../icons/cuelist]link:vccuelist.html[cue
list] for that chaser
. Add
image:../icons/audioinput.png[../icons/audioinput]link:audiotriggers.html[audio
triggers] widget
. In the audio trigger properties: choose proper frequency band (or use
volume band), set type to
image:../icons/virtualconsole.png[../icons/virtualconsole]VC Widget and
select your image:../icons/cuelist.png[../icons/cuelist]cue list. Audio
trigger will press image:../icons/forward.png[../icons/forward]"next"
button on the cuelist.
. now adjust parameters:
* enable threshold - when the volume goes over enable threshold, the
button will be pushed.
* disable threshold - when the button is pushed, it won't be pushed
again before the volume goes below this level. This is so that the
button is pushed only once per beat
* divisor - the button will be pushed every x-th beat - when you want to
advance the chaser every other beat, put here 2, every 4-th beat - put
4, etc.
. close properties, start Operate mode, enable audiotriggers and that's
it.

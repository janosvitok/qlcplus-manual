== image:../icons/slidermatrix.png[../icons/slidermatrix] Simple Desk

The simple desk emulates a typical lighting console that is able to
control a full 512-channel DMX universe with a multiple cue stacks
operated with playback sliders. +
Simple desk is divided into two main areas: *channels* (top area) and
*cues* (bottom area). +
The channels area reflects exactly the current status of each DMX
channel of each universe. If channels are controlled with no project
loaded, users have a completely manual control of them. +
When a project is loaded, instead, moving a Simple desk channel will
override any other QLC+ function trying to control that channel. A
visual indication will turn the channel background to red, informing the
user that Simple desk now has the total control of it. +
This is very useful in some live circumstances where a running function
needs some manual adjustment. +
To "disengage" Simple desk from overriding channels, just click on the
reset button. Resetting channels will either bring them back to zero or
to the value previously set by a function. +
 +
Cues operates separately from other QLC+ components. For example, cues
within the cue stack are not visible in the
link:functionmanager.html[Function Manager] and
link:concept.html#Scene[Scenes] are not visible in the cue stack.

=== Controls - Universe

The universe box contains the sliders that are used to control
individual DMX channels in the first DMX universe. Since 512 sliders
cannot fit nicely on the screen at the same time, they have been divided
into pages. By default, each page contains 32 sliders but that can be
link:#Tuning[tuned].

all channels to fixture channels. Please note that if no fixtures has
been defined, the second mode will produce an empty result

page by writing the page number directly into this box or use the mouse
wheel to skip between pages quickly.

=== Controls - Playback

The playback box contains a bunch of playback sliders each of which may
contain a cue stack. The playbacks can be used to "play back" the
contents of their cue stacks and they can also be used to adjust their
overall intensity of the cue.

[cols=",",]

|image:../icons/check.png[../icons/check] |Select the currently-active
playback, whose cue stack is shown on the right side of the screen.

|*Playback slider* |Adjust the intensity of playback's cue stack. When
the slider is drawn all the way to zero, the cue stack is stopped. Any
value above zero will start replaying the playbacks' cue stack.

|image:../icons/flash.png[../icons/flash] |Flash the playback's first
cue.

=== Controls - Cue Stack

The cue stack box shows the contents of the currently selected playback.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|image:../icons/back.png[../icons/back] |Skip to the previous cue (or
start playback on the last cue in the cue stack with full intensity).

|image:../icons/player_stop.png[../icons/player_stop] |Stop the
currently active cue stack.

|image:../icons/forward.png[../icons/forward] |Skip to the next cue (or
start playback on the first cue in the cue stack with full intensity).

|image:../icons/edit.png[../icons/edit] a|
Switch to/from cue edit mode. When this button is pressed, you can edit
the contents of individual cues; the currently active cue's contents are
shown on the DMX sliders.

The Fade In speed, Fade Out speed and Duration as well as the name of
individual cues can be adjusted with the speed dials that are displayed
in a separate tool window. You can also select multiple cues to adjust
their speeds all at the same time, but then the DMX sliders are disabled
to prevent you from accidentally overwriting all cue contents with the
same values.

|image:../icons/record.png[../icons/record] |Record a new cue, taking
its contents from the current DMX slider values.

|*Cue Stack* a|
This box displays the contents of the currently selected playback's cue
stack, along with the index number (1, 2, 3...), Fade In speed, Fade Out
speed, Duration and an optional name for each cue.

You can change the cue order by dragging the cues on top of each other,
either one at a time or multiple cues at the same time.

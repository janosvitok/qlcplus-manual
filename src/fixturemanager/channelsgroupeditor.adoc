=== Channel Groups Editor

The Channel Groups editor it activated by clicking on the "Channels
Groups" tab in the link:fixturemanager.html[Fixture Manager] panel. +
With this functionality (introduced in QLC+ version 4.0.0), it is
possible to create groups of channels with the same functionality. +
For example, if you have 20 PARs you might want to control the RED
channel of all of them with a single fader. +

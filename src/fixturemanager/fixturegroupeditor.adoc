=== Fixture Group Editor

The Fixture Group Editor is used when you select a
link:concept.html#FixtureGroup[Fixture Group] in the
link:fixturemanager.html[Fixture Manager]. This editor can be used to
describe the physical arrangement of the
link:concept.html#Fixtures[fixtures] and their
link:concept.html#Head[heads] that are assigned to the group.

==== Controls

Each Fixture Group has a name (for your convenience) and the fixture
configuration in an unlimited [X,Y] grid. You can adjust the size of the
grid as well as the placement of individual fixture heads on the grid.

The fixture grid displays the current fixture/head arrangement in the
selected group. You can switch places between two heads as well as fill
up spaces or create empty spaces between heads simply by dragging the
heads on top of each other in the grid.

When using fixture groups in RGB Matrices, each cell in the grid
represents one colored (or monochrome) pixel in a graphic scene rendered
by the RGB Matrix.

Each cell is displayed with an info text that contains the following
information:

* The name of the fixture as well as an icon
* *H:* represents the head number
* *A:* represents the fixture's address
* *U:* represents the fixture's universe

|*Width* |Adjusts the grid width (number of columns on the X-axis).

|*Height* |Adjusts the grid height (number of rows on the Y-axis).

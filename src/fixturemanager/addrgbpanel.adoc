=== image:../icons/rgbpanel.png[../icons/rgbpanel,width=32] Add RGB Panel

On the market you can easily find LED strips that you can wire as you
prefer to create a RGB Panel (or matrix). This dialog allows you to
quickly create and setup a RGB Panel. It is a dedicated dialog to help
you with the most annoying process of creating fixtures manually
depending on the desiderd layout. +
Please note that once the panel is created, the only way to modify the
layout is manually.

==== Panel creation

When clicking OK on this dialog two things will happen: +

* QLC+ will create a fixture for each row of the panel. They can be
considered like if the panel is composed by individual RGB bars.
* QLC+ will create a fixture group representing the panel with heads
already in the right displacement

Once a RGB panel is created, it is straight forward to go to the
link:functionmanager.html[Function Manager], create a new
link:concept.html#RGBMatrix[RGB Matrix] and start using the panel very
quickly. +

Let's have a look at every option in this panel:

[cols="^,^",]
|===
|*Panel Properties* |

|*Name* |An arbitrary string that can be used to name the RGB panel

|*Universe* |The universe where the RGB Panel is going to start. If the
panel requires a number of channels that don't fit in a single universe,
it will span across multiple universes, starting from the one selected
with this option.

|*Address* |The DMX start address where the RGB Panel has to be mapped

|*Size* |

|*Columns* |The RGB Panel number of columns (or the number of pixels per
row)

|*Rows* |The RGB Panel number of rows (or the number of pixels per
column)

|*Physical* |

|*Width* |The physical width in millimeters of the RGB Panel

|*Height* |The physical height in millimeters of the RGB Panel

|*Orientation* |

|*Top-Left* |The first pixel will be located on the top-left corner of
the panel

|*Top-Right* |The first pixel will be located on the top-right corner of
the panel

|*Bottom-Left* |The first pixel will be located on the bottom-left
corner of the panel

|*Bottom-Right* |The first pixel will be located on the bottom-right
corner of the panel

|*Displacement* |

|*Snake* |The panel displacement follows a "snake" logic. It means the
next pixel of the end of a row is on the same column of the next row.
Then the other pixels follow in the opposite direction.

|*Zig-Zag* |The panel displacement follows a "zig-zag" logic. It means
the next pixel of the end of a row is on the first column of the next
row.

|*Direction* |

|*Horizontal* |Pixel addresses are incremented horizontally.

|*Vertical* |Pixel addresses are incremented vertically.

=== image:../icons/fade.png[../icons/fade] Channel Properties Configuration

This window displays a tree with items nested in a
Universes/Fixtures/Channels structure. +
On the right side of each fixture's channel are displayed the available
options that can be set to modify the behaviour of each single
channel. +

==== Channels properties

*Can fade*

Determine if a channel is included or excluded in the QLC+ fade
transitions. +
By default all the channels are affected by the Fade In and Fade Out
timings of the QLC+ functions. +
When this property is unchecked, a channel will not fade, meaning that a
fade transition from 20 to 200, will set the channel immediately to
200. +
This is useful for example for Pan/Tilt channels of moving heads, where
you want the motors to avoid fading but immediately go to the final
value.

*Behaviour*

Force the channel behaviour according to the link:concept.html#HTP[HTP]
and link:concept.html#LTP[LTP] rules. When changing the behaviour of a
channel, the dropdown list will highlight in red, showing evidence that
the channels has been modified. +
*Note: Use this functionality only if you know what you're doing and
fully understand how HTP and LTP work*

*Modifier*

Channels modifiers are a powerful tool to modify the behaviour of a
channel by acting at the end of the DMX value calculation, right before
the link:concept.html#GrandMaster[Grand Master] modification. +
By default all the channels will follow a linear rule, meaning that the
original DMX value will be equal to the output DMX value. (0-0, 1-1, ...
, 255-255) +
When clicking on this button, the Channel Modifier Editor panel
(described below) will be displayed.

 +
When dealing with a lot of fixtures of the same type, you might want to
check the "Apply changes to fixtures of the same type" check box. +
This means that changing a channel property will affect all the channels
of the same type and fixture in the list. +
This can save you quite a lot of time when setting up your projects for
the first time.

==== Channel Modifier Editor

The channel modifier editor is presented like this: +
image:../images/channelmodifier.png[../images/channelmodifier] +
 +
On the right side of the window, a list of available modifier templates
is displayed. +
Clicking on a template in the list, will show the curve preview on the
left side of the window. +
A modifier curve is composed by a number of lines representing how a DMX
channel should be modified when its value changes. +
Each line starts and ends with a so called "handler". A modifier can
have a virtually infinite number of handlers, but there must be always
one handler on the DMX value 0 and one handler on the DMX value 255 to
cover all the DMX values range. +
Basically the X coordinate of the preview represents the original DMX
value and the Y coordinate represents the modified DMX value. +
When clicking on a handler this gets clearer as the fields above the
curve preview are filled with the said values. +
Handlers can be simply moved with the mouse by dragging them around or
by manually changing the values of the original or modified DMX
values. +
 +
To create a new template just select an existing template, give it a new
name and add/remove handlers as needed with the
image:../icons/edit_add.png[../icons/edit_add] and
image:../icons/edit_remove.png[../icons/edit_remove] buttons. +
When done, just click the image:../icons/filesave.png[../icons/filesave]
button and your template will be saved in your user templates folder.

page to locate this folder.

==== Channel Modifier Templates

QLC+ delivers a few templates that might cover the most common cases.

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Always Full* |Fix ("park") the channel value to 100% (255), regardless
of other QLC+ mechanisms (except blackout and universe passthrough).
Useful for e.g. dimmer channels.

|*Always Half* |Fix ("park") the channel value to 50% (127). Useful for
keeping Pan/Tilt channels at a neutral position.

|*Always Off* |Fix ("park") the channel value to 0% (0). Useful for
disabling wrong fixtures.

|*Exponential Deep* |

|*Exponential Medium* |

|*Exponential Shallow* |

|*Exponential Simple* |

|*Inverted* |Invert a Pan/Tilt channel where a product doesn't have this
feature by factory default.

|*Linear* |Default curve, same as when no modifier is set.

|*Logarithmic Deep* |This template can improve the fade transitions of
LED-based fixtures, trying to bring them back to a more linear effect

|*Logarithmic Medium* |

|*Logarithmic Shallow* |

|*Preheat 5%* |May extend lamp life by keeping them at 5% minimum

|*Threshold* |Converts dimmer channel to switch channel (off below 128,
full above)

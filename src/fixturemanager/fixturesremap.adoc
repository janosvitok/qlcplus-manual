=== image:../icons/remap.png[../icons/remap,width=32] Fixtures remapping

Starting from version 4.4.1, QLC+ offers a functionality called fixtures
remapping. +
When performing live shows in different venues, you may only be able to
find out at the last minute which link:concept.html#Fixtures[fixtures]
are installed there. Well, fixtures remapping helps you to use your
existing projects in this and many other situations, such as when you
need to replace a faulty fixture or when you want to use hired in
equipment alongside your own. +
For example, you can set up a project with just one PAR, one moving head
and one scanner. When reaching the venue where the show is going to take
place, you can remap your fixtures to those you find there, for example
50 PARs, 30 moving heads and 15 scanners. +
With QLC+, it takes just a few minutes to do this operation! +
 +
Fixtures remapping allows you to perform 1-to-1 or 1-to-many
reassignments of entire fixtures or single channels. QLC+ will try as
far as possible to reassign the original channels used in the project to
new channels in the same category. +
When you confirm the remapping operation, a new project will be
automatically saved to preserve your original project. +
All the fixtures, scenes, EFX, Virtual Console widgets and audio
triggers found in the original project will be remapped so that they
work on the new fixtures list. +

==== Remapping window

Let's now explain how to use the fixture remapping window, starting from
a screenshot of a complete example: +

 +
And now, here is a detailed explanation of each element of the remapping
window. +
 +

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|*Source fixtures* |On the left side of the window, there is a tree
representing the universes, fixtures and channels used in your project.
This list cannot be changed in this window.

|*Remapped fixtures* |On the right side of the window, there is a tree
representing the universes, fixtures and channels where you are going to
remap your source fixtures.

|image:../icons/edit_add.png[../icons/edit_add] |Add one or more
fixtures to the Remapped fixtures list. Clicking this button will open
the link:addeditfixtures.html[Add/Edit Fixtures] window. Please note
that once a fixture is added, it cannot be modified, so if you need
specific names or quantity, remember to do it before adding the new
fixtures

|image:../icons/edit_remove.png[../icons/edit_remove] |Remove the
selected link:concept.html#Fixtures[Fixture] from the remapped fixtures
list.

|image:../icons/remap.png[../icons/remap] |This is probably the most
important button in the window. It allows you to determine the
connection between a source ficture and a remapped fixture. The
connections can be performed either between single channels or on whole
fixtures. +
In the first case you will need to select the source channel from the
source fixtures list and a target channel from the remapped fixtures
list. +
In the second case you will need to select a fixture from the source
fixtures list and a target fixture from the remapped fixtures list. +
Wrong selections will cause an error message to popup. For example you
cannot remap a channel to a fixture and vice-versa. +
If the connection is valid, it will be represented as a line in the
white area between the source list and the remapped list.

|image:../icons/fileclose.png[../icons/fileclose] |Remove a previously
created remapping connection. Wrong selections will cause an error
popup.

|*Remap fixtures names* |If this is checked, a new remapping connection
between fixtures will also set the target fixture name be the same as
the source fixture name.

|*Destination project name* |The absolute path and name of the remapped
project. For convenience, QLC+ will automatically take the original
project name and will add "(remapped)" at the end of it.

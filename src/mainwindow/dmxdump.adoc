=== image:../icons/add_dump.png[../icons/add_dump,width=32] DMX Dump

The DMX Dump functionality allows you to save the current DMX values
that are being sent to the output universes at a particular moment.
Basically it takes a "snapshot" of DMX channels and saves them for a
later use. +
DMX Dump can save values to a new link:concept.html#Scene[Scene] or
overwite the values of an existing Scene. The "dumped" Scene can also be
added to an existing link:concept.html#Chaser[Chaser], Virtual Console
link:vcbutton.html[button] or link:vcslider.html[slider] +
 +
Please note that:

* Selected Channels/Chasers will be remembered when re-opening this
window
* The DMX values saved are taken before the Grand Master

When opening the DMX Dump window, the following options will appear:

*Scene name*

Defines the name of the Scene that will be created. If no name is
specified, a default name like "New Scene From Live" and a numeric
identification will be set, allowing fast use of this functionality.

image:../icons/scene.png[../icons/scene] *Select an existing Scene*

By clicking on this button, a Function selection window will be
displayed, allowing to select an existing Scene to be overwritten with
the current DMX values. +
 +
*Note:* Overwriting a Scene doesn't ask for confirmation and can be a
potentially dangerous operation if you select the wrong Scene by
mistake. So be careful when using this functionality. +
 +
When a Scene is selected, the DMX Dump window will automatically set two
things for you:

* The "Dump selected channels" option will be checked
* The Fixtures tree will be updated, and only the channels enabled in
the Scene channels will be selected. If you need to overwrite different
channels, just select/unselect them manually before confirming the
operation

*Dump all channels*

If this option is selected, QLC+ will dump all the channels of all the
universes and all the fixtures. To inform the user about what this
option will do, a report in the form of (Universes, Fixtures, Channels)
will be displayed.

*Dump selected channels*

If this option is selected, the panel below will be activated, allowing
you to choose exactly which channels that you want to be saved into a
Scene. They are organized in a tree by Universes and Fixtures.

*Add to*

This section offers you immediate use of your scene in an existing
Virtual Console widget. +
Options are:

*Chaser*: The list contains all the chasers present when DMX Dump window
is opened. Each Chaser has a checkbox that, if checked, will tell QLC+
to add the newly created Scene to the selected chasers. +
This feature is very useful when using link:vccuelist.html[Cue Lists] in
the link:virtualconsole.html[Virtual Console] panel, because the newly
created Scene will appear in the Cue List for immediate use during a
live performance.

 +

*Button*: The list contains all the buttons currently present in your
Virtual Console space. +
When selected, the buttons will be set to activate/deactivate the Scene
just captured. You will see the button label chaning to "Scene from live
..." and a progress number to identify it. +
*Note:* Any previous function associated to the selected buttons will be
overwritten!

 +

*Slider*: The list contains all the sliders currently present in your
Virtual Console space. +
As with buttons, all the selected sliders will be set to control the
Scene just captured. +
*Note 1:* A slider must be in *playback mode* to work as an intensity
controller for a Scene. +
*Note 2:* Any previous function associated with the selected sliders
will be overwritten!

*Dump only non-zero values*

This option will tell QLC+ to save only the channels with values that
are *not* equal to zero. +
If you know what you're doing, this could save project space and avoid
channels conflicts with other Virtual Console widgets.

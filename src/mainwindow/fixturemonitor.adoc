=== image:../icons/monitor.png[../icons/monitor,width=32] DMX Monitor

The DMX Monitor is a useful tool to track the values that are being sent
to the output universes. Only the information related to the required
fixtures are displayed. The monitor's display options have no effect on
actual fixture addressing, after all, it is just a *monitor*. +
The DMX monitor has two display modes: *DMX view* and *2D view*.

==== DMX view

The DMX view shows the all the fixtures of the project, representing
each channel with numbers and icons. It basically represents each
channel in 3 rows:

* The channel group icon
* The channel number
* The channel value

===== Toolbar controls

[cols=",",]
|===
|*2D View* |By clicking on this button, it is possible to switch to the
2D view mode.

|image:../icons/fonts.png[../icons/fonts] |Change the monitor font. To
prevent the numbers from flickering and jumping, you should choose a
proportional (i.e. fixed width) font; for example Monaco, Andale or
Courier. The font property is global, meaning it will not be saved into
your current project, but it will be stored in the QLC+ main
configuration.

|*DMX Channels* |Display fixtures' channel numbers as absolute DMX
channels; channel numbers go from 1 to 512 as they are assigned to each
fixture.

|*Relative Channels* |Display fixtures' channel numbers relative to
fixtures i.e. every fixture's channel numbers always start from 1.

|*DMX Values* |Display channel values as absolute DMX values (0-255).

|*Percent Values* |Display channel values as percentages of 255
(0-100%).

|*Universe* |Select which universe to monitor. The first entry is always
"All universes"
|===

==== 2D view

The monitor 2D view is another way to represent the fixtures of your
project that, instead of numbers, uses a graphical preview trying to
represent as much as possible the real result of a light-emitting
device.

Currently, monitor reflects:

* Master Dimmer
* R/G/B
* C/M/Y
* Color wheels, if they contain RGB color value. Two-color values are
not supported
* Shutter, which is open, unless the capability name contains "close" or
"blackout" (example: "Shutter Close")

In 2D view mode it is possible to select which fixtures to display and
their position in a grid representing the dimensions of a real stage. +
The grid would like to reproduce the front view of a stage, but you can
use it as a generic space as you might like. +
Graphical items can be manually moved by dragging them over the grid,
or, when clicked, they can be configured with the Monitor Fixture Editor
panel that will be displayed on the right side of the window.

===== Toolbar controls

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]

|*DMX View* |By clicking on this button, it is possible to switch to the
DMX view mode.

|*Grid dimensions* |Set the width and the height of the 2D view grid by
changing the values displayed in the two spin boxes

|*Grid units* |Set the 2D view grid measurement units by selecting the
desired one from the drop down menu. Possible options are meters and
feet.

|image:../icons/edit_add.png[../icons/edit_add] |Add a fixture to the 2D
view grid. When clicking on this icon, the fixture selection dialog will
be displayed. Fixtures already added to the view will be greyed as it
isn't possible to add the same fixture twice

|image:../icons/edit_remove.png[../icons/edit_remove] |Remove a fixture
from the 2D view grid. Clicking on this icon will remove the currently
selected fixture. A fixture is highlighted in yellow when selected.

Open the Monitor background picture selection dialog. +
Here it is possible to choose between 3 possible modes: +

* *No background*: the Monitor 2D view won't have any background picture
* *Common background*: the Monitor 2D view will display the chosen
background picture
* *Custom background list*: in this mode it is possible to select a
background picture for a specific QLC+ Function. Just click on the

===== Fixture Item Editor

When a fixture is clicked, it gets highlighted in yellow and the Monitor
Fixture Item Editor is displayed on the right side of the window. +
Following, the possible parameters that it is possible to tune:

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Horizontal position* |Set the position on the grid X axis using the
grid measurement units

|*Vertical position* |Set the position on the grid Y axis using the grid
measurement units

|*Rotation* |Set the rotation angle of the graphical item representing
the selected fixture

|*Color gel* |Set the color gel to be applied to the currently selected
fixture item. This is useful for generic dimmers with a traditional
light bulb, not emitting any color by itself. This function has no
effect on RGB LED fixtures.

|image:../icons/fileclose.png[../icons/fileclose] |Reset a previously
set color gel

===== Pan/Tilt display

PAN/TILT display is schematically displayed using colored rings/arcs
around fixture. **P**urple arc shows **P**AN angle, and **T**urquoise
arc shows **T**ILT angle. Gray dots show PAN/TILT ranges. Zero (middle
of the range) is at the bottom.

In the folowing picture PAN range is 660 degrees and tilt range is 300
degrees. Pan is at counter-clockwise end (-330 deg) and tilt is at -150
deg.

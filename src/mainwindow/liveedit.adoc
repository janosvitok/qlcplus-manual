=== image:../icons/liveedit.png[../icons/liveedit,width=32] Live Edit

Starting from version 4.5.0, QLC+ offers a functionality which allows
the adjustment of your link:concept.html#Functions[Functions] while in
link:concept.html#Modes[Operate Mode]. +
The Live Edit icon
image:../icons/liveedit.png[../icons/liveedit,width=32] is located in
the QLC+ top bar, beside the link:dmxdump.html[DMX Dump] icon
image:../icons/add_dump.png[../icons/add_dump,width=32] and it is
activated only when the user has switched to Operate Mode. +
When clicking on the Live Edit icon, a link:selectfunction.html[Function
selection] panel will be displayed, allowing the selection of the
function you want to adjust. +
When you press OK, the correct editor will be displayed for editing that
function. +
At the moment, the following functions are supported for live editing:

* image:../icons/scene.png[../icons/scene,width=32]
link:concept.html#Scene[Scene] will open a link:sceneeditor.html[Scene
Editor] +
Note that by default the editor will be set in "Blind mode" when you
edit a Scene that is not currently running, in case you want to make the
changes effective only when the Scene is being replayed the next time it
is selected. For a currently running Scene the editor will open in live
mode by default.
* image:../icons/chaser.png[../icons/chaser,width=32]
link:concept.html#Chaser[Chaser] will open a
link:chasereditor.html[Chaser Editor]
* image:../icons/efx.png[../icons/efx,width=32]
link:concept.html#EFX[EFX] will open an link:efxeditor.html[EFX Editor]
* image:../icons/rgbmatrix.png[../icons/rgbmatrix,width=32]
link:concept.html#RGBMatrix[RGB Matrix] will open an
link:rgbmatrixeditor.html[RGB Matrix Editor] +
 +
The types of functions listed in the link:selectfunction.html[Function
selection] can be selected by using the filter check boxes at the bottom
of the panel. +
There is an option at the top of the panel to list currently running
functions only. +
 +
Note that if another function is running when performing a live edit,
HTP channels in the other function may prevent some adjustments from
being seen on the stage.

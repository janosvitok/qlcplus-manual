=== image:../icons/diptool.png[../icons/diptool,width=32] DMX Address Tool

The DMX address tool is a quite easy/self explanatory functionality of
QLC+ introduced in version 4.3.2. +
It helps you to calculate your fixtures addresses quickly in a visual
way. +
A representation of a common 10way DIP switch is displayed and you can
select the background color, the horizontal and vertical orientation, so
that the DIP switch is displayed exactly as you would see it on your
fixture. +
 +
Note particularly the following, which applies to the 10th switch.
Usually, it is used to enable/disable the DMX feature of a fixture, so
if your product manual says it has to be raised to enable the DMX
control, then remember to do it even if QLC+ displays it set to OFF.

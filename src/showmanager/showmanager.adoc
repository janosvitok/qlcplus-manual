== image:../icons/show.png[../icons/show] Show Manager

The Show Manager has been introduced in QLC+ starting from version
4.0.0, after forking the original QLC code on November 5th, 2012. +
 +
This feature is meant to give users the possibility of setting up a time
driven show in a friendly and completely graphical way. +
The graphic interface shows a multitrack view, typical of audio
sequencers or video editing softwares, and with it users are allowed to
place QLC+ link:concept.html#Functions[Functions] at the desired place
and time in the view. +
Show Manager gives a lot of flexibility during a
link:concept.html#Show[Show] creation thanks to its visual-oriented
approach. Once understood the basic elements, it is very easy to create,
move or edit the existing functions and improve a Show by adding new
tracks to it. +
 +
Typical use cases of Shows are those gigs where a band plays songs
following a metronome and the light show has always to be the same,
following the music. +
Another case are visual entertainment shows, where dancers or singers
follow some music and lights create the atmosphere at the right time. +
 +
The Show Manager drives users to make large use of the Sequence
function. Here's the explanation of the difference between a Chaser and
a Sequence. +

=== Sequences vs Chasers

Even if the link:concept.html#Sequence[Sequence] and the
link:concept.html#Chaser[Chaser] functions have some common ground,
they're not the same thing. +
If not done yet, you are invited to read once again their definitions in
the link:concept.html[Basic Concepts & Glossary] page of this
documentation. +
The main differences are:

* *Steps*: The steps of a Chaser can represent any QLC+ Function, while
the steps of a Sequence represents different values of the same
link:concept.html#Scene[Scene]. +
In other words, a Chaser is an independent function, while a Sequence
can exist only on top of a Scene. +
The reason for this is, as mentioned before, the visual approach of the
Show Manager. If a track of a Show is the graphical representation of a
Scene, then it's more intuitive to think that each Sequence created on
that track is a function controlling the values of that Scene.
* *Order*: Chasers can be reproduced in any order (Forward, Backward,
Ping-Pong, Random) while in the Show Manager, Sequences are always
reproduced from the beginning to the end (Forward). Again, this is
related to the visual aspect of the Show Manager, where the playback has
a natural time forward direction. +
On the other hand, Sequences created with the Function Manager can have
the same order properties of Chasers.
* *Editing*: The editing approach between Sequences and Chaser is
different too. +
Normally the workflow of a Chaser is: create a Function, then add it to
the Chaser as a step. +
The workflow of a Sequence is: create a Scene, create a Sequence on top
of it, add steps to it. +
The Sequence approach might be very effective when you design a light
show if you can pre-determine which fixtures you're going to use.
Another major advantage of Sequence editing is that when you create a
new step, the values of the previous step are copied in the new one. So
the user is simply required to adjust the differences between them. +
If you are going to create 500 steps and they're all different, then
Sequences and Chasers will take almost the same time to be created. +
* *Synchronization*: another major advantage of using Sequences in a
Show is that a Show can easily be extended (or reduced) while with a
Chaser you will have a hard time to synchronize the new functions to the
existing ones. +
An example. Let's say your project controls 50 fixtures that are a
mixture of moving heads, PARs and scanners. At some point you buy a
couple of lasers and you want them to become active in existing scenes
at precise moments in time. The Show Manager allows you to do that in a
few minutes! You just need to add the 2 new fixtures to the project, add
a track to the Shows affected by the change and create a few Sequences
to control the lasers. +
The Show Manager resume functionality will also save you a lot of time
when testing the new changes. +
With Chasers you'd probably have to deal with complex
link:concept.html#Collection[Collections] and review the timings of a
few steps before finding the right combination.

|===
|image:../icons/show.png[../icons/show] |CTRL+H |Create a new
link:concept.html#Show[Show]. A Show is represented as a multitrack
workspace where tracks, sequences and audio elements can be added

| | |

|*Shows list* | |This drop down box lists the currently created Shows.
Clicking on a Show will display it.

|image:../icons/edit_add.png[../icons/edit_add] |CTRL+N a|
Create a new track or add existing functions to the Show. When clicking
on this button a window is displayed, allowing you to perform the
following operations:

* Create a new track: This creates a new empty track that will serve as
a container for Sequences and Audio functions.
* Import an existing Scene. This will create a new track and a 10
seconds Sequence with one single step representing the selected Scene.
* Import an existing Sequence: this operation scans the existing tracks
and if it finds a track already bound to the Sequence's bound Scene,
then add the Sequence to that track at the cursor position. +
If no compatible track is found, a new track will be created and bound
to the Sequence's bound Scene.
* Import an existing link:concept.html#Chaser[Chaser]: add a Chaser
function at the cursor position on the selected track. If no track is
available, it will create a new one.
* Import an existing link:concept.html#Audio[Audio]: add an Audio
function at the cursor position on the selected track. If no track is
available, it will create a new one.
* Import an existing link:concept.html#EFX[EFX]: add an EFX function at
the cursor position on the selected track. If no track is available, it
will create a new one.
* Import an existing link:concept.html#RGBMatrix[RGB Matrix]: add a RGB
Matrix function at the cursor position on the selected track. If no
track is available, it will create a new one.

A Show can have a virtually infinite number of tracks.

|image:../icons/sequence.png[../icons/sequence] |CTRL+E |Create a new
link:concept.html#Sequence[Sequence] item and bind it to the selected
track.

|image:../icons/audio.png[../icons/audio] |CTRL+A |Create a new
link:concept.html#Audio[Audio] item. An audio item simply represents an
audio file. Audio items can be added on any track, but if you want to to
create a separate track for it, just create an new track. +
*Note:* It is possible to display the waveform preview of an audio item
just by right clicking it and selecting the channels you want to display
(mono, left channel, right channel, stereo) +
*Warning:* Even though QLC+ allows you to, it is not possible to play
two audio files simultaneously. Especially on Windows, you might
experience unwanted crashes.

|image:../icons/editcopy.png[../icons/editcopy] |CTRL+C |Copy the
currently selected item into QLC+ clipboard

|image:../icons/editpaste.png[../icons/editpaste] |CTRL+V a|
Paste QLC+ clipboard content at the cursor position. When performing
this operation two checks are performed:

Overlapping: checks if the item you're going to paste overlaps with an
existing item in the selected track

Validity: If you're pasting a Sequence, QLC+ will verify that the
Sequence contents are compatible with the currently selected track

|image:../icons/editdelete.png[../icons/editdelete] |Del |Delete the
currently selected item. This can be a sequence, an audio item or a
track. Note that deleting a track will delete also all its
sequences/audio children. +
*Note: Show Manager will only perform a "visual removal" of functions.
To permanently delete them, please use the
link:functionmanager.html[Function Manager]*

| | |

|image:../icons/color.png[../icons/color] |CTRL+R |Assign a custom color
to the selected item

|image:../icons/lock.png[../icons/lock] |CTRL+K |Lock or unlock then
selected item. Once an item is locked, it cannot be dragged on the
timeline anymore

|image:../icons/speed.png[../icons/speed] |CTRL+T |Open a window where
you can adjust the selected item start time and total duration. The
behaviour of the latter will depend on the selected item. +
On Audio and Video items it does nothing. +
On Sequences and Chasers it will stretch all the steps timings to fit to
the desired duration. +
On EFXs and RGB Matrices some extra options will be displayed, allowing
to stretch the original function or loop the function until the desired
duration is reached.

|image:../icons/grid.png[../icons/grid] |CTRL+G |Enable/disable the
"Snap to grid" functionality. The view will be filled with vertical bars
corresponding to the header markers (time or BPM) +
Snapping to grid will correct your items by dragging them to the nearest
reference bar

|*00:00:00.000* | |This field displays the cursor time position both if
the playback is stopped or activated

| | |

|image:../icons/player_play.png[../icons/player_play]image:../icons/player_pause.png[../icons/player_pause]
|Space |Start the current Show playback from the cursor position, or
pause it and leave the lights on.

|image:../icons/player_stop.png[../icons/player_stop] |CTRL+Space |Stop
the current Show playback. Clicking once will stop the cursor at the
current position for resuming later. Clicking twice will restore the
cursor to 0 seconds. +
*Hint:* When resuming a show with audio tracks, please keep in mind that
audio accuracy depends on the file formats you are using. For example
MP3 files resume is not particularly accurate, while wave files resume
is.

| | |

|*Time markers* | |This drop down menu lets you to choose the desired
time division to display for your Show. +
This can be either 'Time'. 'BPM 4/4', 'BPM 3/4' or 'BPM 2/2'

|*BPMs* | |When a BPM time division mode is selected, this field lets
you decide the appropriate BPM to set for you Show. This ranges from 20
to 240. +
This can be quite useful when dealing with electronic music or BPM
synchronized shows

=== Just 4 steps

The Show Manager has been set up to be used quickly and easily.
Basically, with just 4 steps a complete link:concept.html#Show[Show] can
be created:

. Add a new Show image:../icons/show.png[../icons/show]
. Add a track image:../icons/edit_add.png[../icons/edit_add]
. Add some link:concept.html#Function[Functions]
. {blank}
* *Preview*: This option is available only on audio items. It will
display the waveform preview for right, left or stereo channels when
available
* *Align to cursor*: This option will move the selected item to the
cursor position
* image:../icons/lock.png[../icons/lock]*Lock/Unlock*: Once an item is
locked, it cannot be dragged on the timeline anymore
. Edit your Functions

 +
To increase the complexity of the Show, more Functions can be added.
Just repeat the above steps depending on your needs. +

=== And finally...play! image:../icons/player_play.png[../icons/player_play]

When a complete show has finally been created, it can be played just by
clicking on the Play icon. +
Playback always starts from the current cursor postion. The cursor
position can be changed by clicking on the time line.

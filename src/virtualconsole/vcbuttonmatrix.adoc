A Button Matrix is basically just a way for quickly creating multiple
link:vcbutton.html[Buttons] at the same time inside a common container
link:vcframe.html[Frame].

When creating a new button matrix, you can assign functions to each of
the buttons quite quickly with the link:addvcbuttonmatrix.html[Add
Button Matrix] dialog.

==== Configuration

Refer to link:vcframe.html[Frame] and link:vcbutton.html[Button] on how
to configure them.

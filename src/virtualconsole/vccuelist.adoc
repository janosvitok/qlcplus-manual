=== image:../icons/cuelist.png[../icons/cuelist] Virtual Console Cue List

A Cue List provides a list of link:concept.html#Functions[Functions]
that you can step through with a single keyboard key. The Cue List is
designed for theatrical performances where the lighting operator needs
only to follow the script and toggle the next cue as the performance
goes on.

The first column on the Cue List displays the cue number that runs from
1 to infinity and beyondhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear[*].
The second column shows the individual
link:concept.html#Functions[Function] name that has been assigned to
that particular cue.

*Please note* that only link:concept.html#Chaser[Chasers] can be
assigned to a Cue List, for the simple reason that the Chaser is the
only function with a duration. Since any other Function can be added as
a step to a Chaser with the link:chasereditor.html[Chaser Editor], it is
simple to create the desired Cues by mixing
link:concept.html#Scene[Scenes],
link:concept.html#Collection[Collections], and so on...

==== Configuration

Cue Lists can be configured with the object properties button
image:../icons/edit.png[../icons/edit] found in the toolbar or by double
clicking on the Cue List widget. +

*Cue list name*

Set the friendly name of the Cue List. The name appears as the Cue
List's second column title.

*Cue list*

*Chaser*: Select the link:concept.html#Chaser[Chaser] to associate with
the Cue List. +
image:../icons/attach.png[../icons/attach] Associate a
link:concept.html#Chaser[Chaser] with the Cue List using the
link:selectfunction.html[Select Function] dialog. +
image:../icons/detach.png[../icons/detach] Detach the selected Chaser
from the Cue List. +
 +
*Playback buttons layout*: Select how the playback can be controlled
with the two available buttons. +
 +
*Behavior of the Next/Previous buttons when the chaser is not active*:
Select the behaviour of the Next and Previous buttons when the Chaser is
not running. Basically this option determines the action that should be
taken when the Chaser is started for the first time or when the Chaser
is stopped at any cue in the list. +
The possible choices are:

* Run chaser from first/last cue (default): This is the default
behaviour and it will run the Chaser with its original running order
(Normal or Reverse)
* Run chaser from next/previous cue: Start the Chaser from the cue where
it has been interrupted
* Select next/previous cue: This performs only a selection of a cue,
without running the Chaser
* Do nothing: No action is taken in this case. This is useful when
working only with the Play/Stop button

*Playback*

You can select the key that you want to use to start/stop the selected
cue in the Cue List with this option. The key combination is shown in
the text field; if the field is empty, there is no key combination
currently attached to the Cue List.

*Next cue*

You can select the key that you want to use to skip to the next cue in
the Cue List with this option. The key combination is shown on the text
field; if the field is empty, there is no key combination currently
attached to the Cue List.

*Previous cue*

You can select the key that you want to use to skip to the previous cue
in the Cue List with this option. The key combination is shown on the
text field; if the field is empty, there is no key combination currently
attached to the Cue List.

*Side Fader*

*Behaviour*: Select the behaviour of the side fader.

* If "Crossfade" is selected, a fader will be displayed on the left side
of the panel, implementing the crossfade functionality between cues.
* If "Steps" is selected, a fader will be displayed on the left side of
the panel, and its value will determine which cue of the Cue List to
run.

 +

==== Operate mode

When switching QLC+ to link:concept.html#Modes[Operate Mode], the Cue
List will become active, allowing the selection of the desired cues
included in the associated Chaser. +
 +
Pressing the ENTER key will start the selected cue. +
 +
The following items are displayed at the bottom of the Cue List
widget: +
 +

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|*Cue progress bar* |A progress bar showing the current running cue
status. +
When a fade in speed is set and is not set to "default" the bar will be
colored in green. +
During the hold time the bar will be colored in blue. The text displayed
on the bar is the time remaining for the cue to end. +
If the cue duration is set to infinite (∞), the bar will just display
the fade in progress in green.

|image:../icons/slider.png[../icons/slider] |When clicked, this button
will open/close a side panel showing a fader to control crossfade or
step selection. +
(See next chapter for Crossfade details)

|image:../icons/player_play.png[../icons/player_play] +
image:../icons/player_pause.png[../icons/player_pause] +
image:../icons/player_stop.png[../icons/player_stop] |There are 3
playback states that a Cue list can assume: *running*, *paused* and
*stopped*. +
The layout of the playback control buttons can be decided in the
configuration dialog, and the playback rules applied are always as
follows: +
image:../icons/player_play.png[../icons/player_play] +
When clicked from a stopped state, the playback starts from the
currently selected cue. If no cue is selected, the playback starts from
the first cue according to the associated Chaser running order. +
Once clicked, the button icon changes depending on the chosen buttons
layout, which could be "pause" or "stop". +
When clicked from a paused state, the playback will be resumed from
where it was left. +
 +
image:../icons/player_pause.png[../icons/player_pause] +
When clicked, the playback of the currently running cues is paused,
freezing everything that was running to the current state (lights will
stay on, motors will stop moving, etc). +
The button background will turn into a light blue, to indicate that
clicking it again will resume the cue playback from where it was left. +
*Note:* It is possible to pause fade in and hold phases, but not a fade
out. +
 +
image:../icons/player_stop.png[../icons/player_stop] +
When clicked, the currently running cue will be stopped, and the cue
selection will stay on the last played cue. Any paused state will be
reset and lights will be shut down. +
If the buttons layout is "Play/Pause + Stop", pressing this button for
the second time, will bring back the selected cue to the first cue of
the Chaser (or the last if the running order is reversed)

|image:../icons/back.png[../icons/back] |Go back to the previous cue in
the Cue List, which will then be reproduced. When the top is reached,
the previous cue will be the last cue of the Cue List

|image:../icons/forward.png[../icons/forward] |Go to the next cue in the
Cue List, which will then be reproduced. When reaching the bottom, the
next cue will be the first of the Cue List
|===

==== Crossfade

The side fader can be used to manually control crossfade between two
consecutive cues. +
 +
The numbers at the top and bottom of the fader show the "current cue"
and "next cue". +
The label for the current cue has a blue label. This will be at 100%
when the playback of the Cue List is started. +
The label for the next cue has an orange label and will be at 0% when
the playback of the Cue List is started. +
 +
When the Cue list is running, the crossfade fader controls the intensity
of the associated cues, overriding their Fade In and Fade Out speeds and
so allowing manual control of the transition. +
 +
After the fader has been moved to the opposite end of its travel, the
following changes take place: +

* The orange next cue label changes to blue. This indicates that the old
next cue has become the new current cue.
* The blue current cue label changes to orange and the number of the cue
is increased by 2. So this fader now controls the cue which comes after
the old next cue.

 +

==== Hint

When a cue is added to a Chaser using the link:chasereditor.html[Chaser
Editor], the default duration is set to 0. +
To avoid the cues in the Cue List looping frantically without any
result, set the duration of your cues, either by double clicking on the
duration field or by using the Speed Dial
widgetimage:../icons/speed.png[../icons/speed] +
Note that if you need scenes that you're going to crossfade manually
with the Cue List widget, you probably will want to set the duration of
the cues to "infinite" (∞) using the link:vcspeeddial.html[Speed Dial
widget]. This can be enabled in the Chaser Editor by clicking on the
image:../icons/speed.png[../icons/speed] button.

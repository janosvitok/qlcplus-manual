=== image:../icons/button.png[../icons/button] Virtual Console Button

A Button is the simplest and at the same time one of the most powerful
widget in QLC+; with it, you can start, stop and flash your Functions. +
When activated in toggle mode, the Button border will turn to green, but
if a Function attached to a Button is started from another Virtual
Console widget, the Button border will turn to orange, to indicate that
the Function is active but not actually controlled by the Button.
Pressing a Button in "monitoring" state will take control of the running
Function and the Button border will turn to green. Another press and the
attached Function will be stopped.

==== Configuration

Buttons can be configured with the properties
image:../icons/edit.png[../icons/edit] button found in the toolbar or by
double clicking the button itself.

|*Button label* |Set the friendly name of the button. The name appears
on the button in Virtual Console. *NOTE:* If you set an icon to a button
with the *Edit -> Icon -> Choose* menu, the icon will override this

from the button

|*External input* a|
You can attach an external input channel from an input device (like a
slider board) to buttons so that you don't always have to use the mouse,
touch screen or keyboard to access the buttons.

* Input universe: The input universe that you wish to provide input data
to the button.
* Input channel: The individual input channel within the selected input
universe that you wish to use for controlling the button.
* Auto Detect: When toggled, you can just press a button on your
external input hardware and it will be automatically assigned to the
button. The latest combination is shown in the text boxes when QLC+
receives input data. If you don't see anything in the boxes, your input
connection might have a problem that you need to fix first.
* Choose...: Shows the link:selectinputchannel.html[Select Input
Channel] dialog that you can use to select an input channel manually.

|*Key combination* a|
You can attach a keyboard key (or key combination) to the button, which
then acts as if you clicked the button directly with your mouse.

|*On button press...* a|
* Toggle Function on/off: When you click the button, the attached
Function is started. When you click the button a second time, the
Function is stopped, unless it has already stopped by itself.
* Flash Function: You can "flash" the attached
link:concept.html#Scene[Scene] when you keep the button pressed. If
another type of Function is attached to the button, nothing happens when
you click it.
* Toggle Blackout: When you click the button, QLC+ will toggle the
link:concept.html#Blackout[blackout mode]
* Stop All Functions: When you click the button, all the Functions that
are running in QLC+ will be stopped immediately. It is possible to
specify a fade out time to wait for all the intensity channels to reach
a zero level

|*Adjust Function intensity* |If checked, this feature will adjust the
intensity of the assigned Function just before playing it when the
button is pressed.

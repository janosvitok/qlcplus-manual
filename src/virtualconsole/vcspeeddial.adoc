=== image:../icons/speed.png[../icons/speed] Virtual Console Speed Dial

Speed dials are meant for adjusting the speed of a set of functions from
virtual console, much like bus-mode sliders in the previous versions of
QLC+. While the bus concept relied on assigning functions and a slider
to the same bus, the speed dial's method is a simpler and more
straightforward one: The user directly selects a set of functions whose
speed properties are controlled with the dial, thus removing the need
for buses in the middle.

The widget is displayed as following: +

==== Widget elements

*(1) Time control buttons*

The plus and minus buttons increment or decrement by one the currently
focused time field of *(4)*. By default the focused field is
milliseconds

*(2) Dial*

The dial can be manually rotated indefinitely to adjust the current
focused time field of *(4)*. By default the focused field is
milliseconds

*(3) Tap Button*

The tap button sets the Speed Dial time value to the interval between
the button press/release actions. The faster it will be pressed, the
lower the time value will be

*(4) Time fields*

The 4 time fields display the current time value of the Speed Dial and
they can be adjusted individually either by entering a number with a
keyboard, or by using the time controls buttons *(1)*, the dial *(2)*,
the tap button *(3)* or presets *(11)*.

*(5) Divider button*

Divide the current time factor by 2 and apply it to the current Speed
Dial time. +
A factor lower than 1x will become a fraction like 1/2x, 1/4x, etc

*(6) Time factor*

Displays the current factor multiplied by the time currently displayed
in *(4)*. +
A factor lower than 1x is a divider. Example: time = 8s.28, factor =
1/4x, result = 02s.07

*(7) Multiplier button*

Multiply the current time factor by 2 and apply it to the current Speed
Dial time.

*(8) Reset button*

Reset the current time factor to 1x and apply it to the current Speed
Dial time.

*(9) Factored time*

Displays the result of the Speed Dial time multiplied by the current
time factor *(6)*

*(10) Apply button*

Applies the current Speed Dial time to the Functions associated. This is
useful when multiple Speed Dials are present in a Virtual Console

*(11) Preset buttons*

This area displays the time presets, if present, added by the user

==== Operation

The speed dial itself looks and works just as the same as the speed
dials in various function editors: There is a *big dial (2)* in the
middle that increases the time when rotated clockwise and decreases it
when rotated counter-clockwise. The plus
image:../icons/edit_add.png[../icons/edit_add,height=16] and minus
image:../icons/edit_remove.png[../icons/edit_remove,height=16] buttons
*(1)* are an alternative way of adjusting the speed.

The *current time* value *(4)* is displayed in four parts. When any of
these fields is clicked, the dial and the plus/minus buttons will
increase/decrease that unit of time. The mouse wheel can also be used
instead of the dial/buttons and the fields also accept values entered on
the numeric keypad.

*h*: Hours

*m*: Minutes

*s*: Seconds

*.xx*: Centiseconds (100ths of a second)

The *tap* button *(3)* can be used to match the time to a beat. The
elapsed time between clicks is measured and this time is set for the
controlled functions, just as if the dial had been adjusted to that
particular time.

For cuelists/chasers and RGB Matrices, the tap button advances the
function to next step/position when speed dial is set to adjust
duration. The tapped tempo must be more than 1/4 of the original
duration.

==== Configuration - Functions tab

Speed dials can be configured with the properties
image:../icons/edit.png[../icons/edit] button found in the toolbar or by
double clicking the speed dial itself.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|*Speed Dial Name* |Change the dial's name.

|*Function table* a|
Displays the list of functions, whose speed value(s) are being
controlled by the dial.

For each speed value (fade in, fade out, duration), it is possible to
set a multiplier.

[cols=",",]
!===
!*Fade In factor* !Select a multiplier to adjust the functions'
link:concept.html#Functions[fade in speed]

!*Fade Out factor* !Select a multiplier to adjust the functions'
link:concept.html#Functions[fade out speed]

!*Duration factor (+tap)* !Select a multiplier to adjust the functions'
link:concept.html#Functions[duration]
!===

This multiplier will be applied to the speed dial value before adjusting
the functions' speed value.

Select *(Not Sent)* so the functions' speed value will not be affected
by this speed dial.

|image:../icons/edit_add.png[../icons/edit_add] |Add function(s) to be
controlled by the speed dial.

|image:../icons/edit_remove.png[../icons/edit_remove] |Remove the
selected functions from the speed dial's list of controlled functions.

==== Configuration - Input tab

Input from an external controller can be configured here

* *Absolute Value*: Select an absolute time range (and precision) that
an external signal will control
* *Tap*: Connect a signal or a key combination to the Speed Dial Tap
button *(3)*
* *Apply*: Connect a signal or a key combination to the Speed Dial apply
button *(10)*

one for value with minimum and maximum and another for tap button.

==== Configuration - Appearance tab

Individual visibility of the widget's layout elements can be switched on
or off here. This way it is possible to save some screen real estate if
some of the fields are not needed (e.g. when controlled by an external
controller, the big dial is not needed).

==== Configuration - Mutliplier tab

Here it is possible to select if the multiply factor should be reset
when the dial *(2)* is manually adjusted and individual external
controls for the multiplier button *(5)*, the divider button *(7)* and
the reset factor button *(8)*

==== Configuration - Presets tab

A preset is a way to have a quick access to a predifined value for a
speed dial. +
Each preset is represented as a button in the speed dial widget layout,
and can be either clicked with the mouse or pressed on a touchscreen, or
associated to a key combination or an external controller input line. +
On the left of the preset tab, there is the list of presets. When
selecting a preset in this list, the button on the right will be able to
edit its properties.

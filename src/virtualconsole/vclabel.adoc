=== image:../icons/label.png[../icons/label] Virtual Console Label

A Label is simply text field that can be placed on the Virtual Console
to give additional information, for example, as a heading for a group of
buttons or the title of a frame.

==== Configuration

You can only set up the text to be displayed in a Label with the
*Rename* image:../icons/editclear.png[../icons/editclear] button. It
does not have any other purpose nor configurable options, other than the
standard link:vcstylingplacement.html[styling & placement options] that
all Virtual Console widgets have.

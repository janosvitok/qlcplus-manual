=== image:../icons/animation.png[../icons/animation] Virtual Console Animation

An Animation widget is a complete tool to operate with the
link:concept.html#Function[RGB Matrices] of your project. +
It displays several graphical elements to fully control a matrix during
live shows. +
Most importantly, it allows you to define a number of so called "custom
controls" to quickly recall presets, colors and properties and apply
them immediately to a running matrix.

==== Introduction

When clicking on the image:../icons/animation.png[../icons/animation]
icon, an Animation widget will be added to your Virtual Console. +
By default, the widget will display 4 elements:

* On the leftmost side, a slider to control the playback and the
intensity of a RGB Matrix. +
The slider movement can be associated to an external controller input
line. +
It behaves exactly like a link:vcslider.html[Virtual Console Slider] in
playback mode.
* On the top right side, two link:concept.html#ClickAndGo[Click & Go]
buttons to set the matrix start and end color. When clicking on them
during the link:concept.html#Modes[Operate Mode], a color picker menu
will be displayed.
* Below the two buttons, a drop down menu to select the desired Matrix
animation or preset.

The space below the animation menu, is reserved for Custom Controls.
They can be defined in the widget configuration window and each of them
will be displayed as a single button. +
Each custom control can be associated to a key combination or an
external controller input line.

==== Configuration

An Animation widget can be configured with the properties
image:../icons/edit.png[../icons/edit] button found in the Virtual
Console toolbar or by double clicking the widget itself.

You can attach an external input channel from an input device (like a
slider board) to the widget slider so that you don't always have to use
the mouse or touch screen to control the Matrix playback or intensity.

* Input universe: The input universe from which you wish to get input
data for the slider.
* Input channel: The individual input channel within the selected input
universe that you wish to use for controlling the slider.
* Auto Detect: When toggled, you can just move/press a
button/slider/knob on your external input hardware and it will be
automatically assigned to the slider. The latest combination is shown on
the text boxes when QLC+ receives input data. If you don't see anything
in the boxes, your input connection might have a problem that you need
to fix first.
* Choose...: Shows the link:selectinputchannel.html[Select Input
Channel] dialog that you can use to select an input channel manually.

===== Custom Controls Page

A custom control is a "shortcut" to a functionality of a RGB Matrix. +
Basically you can control all the options that are normally used in the
link:rgbmatrixeditor.html[RGB Matrix Editor] during the design phase of
a show. The only option you can't control is the Fixture group used by a
RGB Matrix Function. +
In this configuration page the user can define any number of custom
controls depending on the needs during a live performance. +
Each custom control is represented as a button in the Animation widget
layout and can be either clicked with the mouse or pressed on a
touchscreen, or associated to a key combination or an external
controller input line.

== image:../icons/qlcplus-fixtureeditor.png[../icons/qlcplus-fixtureeditor,width=32] Fixture Definition Editor

Fixture Definition Editor is a separate application bundled together
with QLC+ for creating and modifying link:concept.html#Fixtures[fixture
definitions] used by QLC+. The definitions tell QLC+ (and users)
important details about fixtures, such as which channel is used for pan
movement, what value in which channel changes the beam color to green,
how the fixture is reset etc...

The main window in the Fixture Editor is just an empty workspace that
contains the actual editor windows used to edit fixture definitions.

*Important note: for many reasons, you SHOULD NOT save or copy your
custom fixtures in the QLC+ system fixtures folder. The most important
is that when you uninstall QLC+, the system fixtures folder gets
deleted, so your fixtures. +
You are recommended to save them in the user fixtures folder. To find
it, please refer to the link:questionsandanswers.html[Q & A section] of
this documentation.*

=== Fixture Editor

Fixture Editor windows contain everything needed to edit one Fixture
Definition at a time. The windows are separated in five tabs:
link:#general[*General*], link:#physical[*Physical*],
link:#channels[*Channels*], link:#modes[*Modes*] and
link:#aliases[*Aliases*]. +
Tabs are organized in a logical order that should be followed from left
to right when creating a new fixture definition.

[[general]]
==== General Tab

This is the section where the Fixture general information is provided.

!*Manufacturer* !The fixture's manufacturer name. For example
"FooCompany". Please note that if you're adding a definition of a
manufacturer already present in the QLC+ library, you should adopt the
same exact name adopted by the other creators. For example, "IMG
Stageline" is not "img stageline" or "IMG-Stageline"

!*Model* !The fixture's model name. For example "FooZapper 2000". Please
stick to the product manual to fill in this information. No need to
specify the LED configuration like "PAR64 MKII 8x1W LED RGBWAUV USB".
It's just "PAR64 MKII"

!*Type* !The fixture's category type. For an accurate preview, it is
important to fill in the proper category. For example, while a moving
head is most likely a color changer too, the type should be set to
"Moving Head"

!*Author* !The fixture definition author name. Please do not submit
email addresses or references to some website. They will be removed
anyway during review.

[[physical]]
==== Physical Tab

This is the section where the _global_ physical information of the
fixture is provided. +
An identical section is also present in each mode, in case the fixture
allows its physical properties (e.g. pan/tilt range) to be altered
depending on the mode. In that case, the global physical information can
be overridden by _per-mode_ physical information.

*Bulb*

* Type: The type of the actual light source within the fixture.
* Lumens: The light source's total luminous output in lumens.
* Color Temperature (K): The light source's color temperature in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin[Kelvins]

*Lens*

* Name: The type/name of the lens, if applicable.
* Min. degrees: The fixture's minimum beam angle in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)[degrees].

* Depth: The fixture's total depth in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimeter[millimeters].

*Head(s)*

* Type: The method of focusing the beam on different areas. For
stationary fixtures this can be set to Fixed.
* Pan Max Degrees: The maximum pan width in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)[degrees].
* Tilt Max Degrees: The maximum tilt height in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)[degrees].

[[channels]]
==== Channels Tab

The channels tab contains all possible channels that the fixture
understands in all of its modes. The channel order doesn't matter in
this tab at all. Instead, channels are arranged in certain order in each
mode in the *Mode* tab. On the *Channel* tab, only the channel names,
their *capabilities* (i.e. value ranges and their purpose) matters.

[[channel_editor]]
===== Channel Editor

The Channel Editor is used to edit individual channels and the DMX value
ranges of each capability (a green color, a certain gobo, prism
rotation, etc.) that a fixture channel provides. Refer to your fixture's
manual to get a detailed list of the fixture's channels and DMX values.

Here's a few screenshots showing the possible scenarios that can be
encountered while editing a Fixture channel.

|Fig. 3 |Fig. 4
|===

Following, the description of the settings that appear in the Channel
Editor. Reference to the above figures will be done to point you to a
visual context.

*Name*

The channel name. When selecting a channel preset (single capability
channel), a channel name will be automatically suggested, with the
possibility to customize it.

*Preset*

A preset is a sort of shortcut to speed up the definition creation. It
also provides to the QLC+ engine, useful information to recognize and
properly treat a DMX channel. +
It frequently happens that a Fixture has some RGB or CMY channels. A LED
bar might have dozens of them. Therefore, selecting a color preset will
fill in for you all the necessary information that QLC+ needs, with a
single mouse click. (See Fig. 1) +
It is also frequent to find a channel to control Pan/Tilt speed. Some
presets are available for that purpose, indicating also if the speed is
from slow to fast or from fast to slow. Just pick the preset that is
more suitable for the definition you're creating. +
When a preset is selected, all the rest of the editor become inactive.
If a channel has multiple DMX ranges (capabilities), just leave "Preset"
to "Custom" and proceed further with this reading.

*Type*

This indicated the channel's type (its role in the fixture). Selecting a
type, implicitely defines also the channel precedence
(link:concept.html#LTP[LTP] or link:concept.html#HTP[HTP]). It is
therefore very important to pick the correct type here, to avoid
undesired behaviours within QLC+. +
All the intensity/color channel types obey to the *HTP* rule:
*Intensity, Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, White, Amber, UV,
Lime and Indigo*. +
All the other types obey to the *LTP* rule: *Beam, Color, Effect, Gobo,
Maintenance, Nothing, Pan, Tilt, Prism, Shutter and Speed*. +

*Intensity* is used for dimmer / master dimmer channels. +

*Primary colors* (Red, Cyan, White, etc) are used to control single
color channels. Please do not confuse these types with the "Color" type
(see below) +
Note that the link:concept.html#GrandMaster[Grand Master] controls only
Intensity and primary color channels by default. Note also that the
Color Tool in link:sceneeditor.html[Scene Editor] is available only if a
fixture provides *Primary color* channels for RGBAWUV/CMY.

The *Color* type is used to control a fixed color wheel or pre-defined
color macros. _Don't_ assign individual RGBAW/CMY color channels to the
Color type but instead use the *primary color* types as described above

The *Gobo* type is used to control gobo wheel position or indexing.

The *Speed* type is used to control something related to speed (gobo
rotation, rainbow speed, tracking speed).

The *Prism* type is used to control a prism.

The *Shutter* type is used to control a shutter, a strobe or an iris.

The *Beam* type is used to control a beam shaper (such as a zoom
feature).

The *Effect* type is used to control something that doesn't quite fit
into any of the other groups.

The *Maintenance* type is used to control feature such as resetting or a
cooling fan or something similar.

The *Nothing* type is used as a channel spacer or a place holder. Some
channels of this type might be replaced with the link:[alias] feature.

The *Pan* and *Tilt* types are used to control Pan/Tilt (or X/Y)
features of moving heads or lasers

*Default value*

Specify the DMX value (0 to 255) to which a channel is set on power up.
For example, some moving heads position their Pan/Tilt motors half way,
which means the initial DMX channel value is equal to 127.

*Role*

Applicable to channel pairs that make 16 bit values, usually *Pan* or
*Tilt* group, but some newer fixtures support 16 bit dimmer or even RGB,
gobo or focus channels. +
For 8 bit values (e.g. when the fixture supports only 8bit movement,
only one channel for each movement), assign the *Coarse (MSB)* control
byte to the channel. If, however, the fixture supports 16bit (two
channels for each feature), you should assign the *Coarse (MSB)* byte to
the channels that provide coarse value and the *Fine (LSB)* byte to the
channels that provide fine value adjustment. If you are not sure, use
*Coarse MSB*.

*Capabilities*

Displays the list of DMX value ranges for the currently edited channel.
If a channel provides only one capability (for example pan or dimmer)
you should use a channel preset (see above). For more elaborate
capabilities, such as colors or gobos, you should create capability
ranges for each of the colors (for example 0-15 white, 16-32 blue...). +
Specific ranges for each channel can be found in the product manual
under the name "DMX chart". +
Entering DMX ranges is pretty straight forward. The entry area is
organized as a spreadsheet where range values and descriptions can be
entered continuously just by pressing the TAB key. +

*Preset*

Each capability can be enriched with a so called "preset", which tells
the QLC+ engine more useful information about a range of DMX values. +
For example if the capability is "Shutter open", a preset called
"ShutterOpen" is available so that QLC+ knows exactly how to treat the
range. +
Depending on the preset type, one or more additional information could
be entered:

* ColorMacro: allows to pick a single color used tyipically on color
wheels
* ColorDoubleMacro: allows to pick two colors to represent an
intermediate position of a color wheel (Fig. 3)
* GoboMacro: allows to select a gobo picture to be used when entering
the capability range (Fig. 4)
* StrobeFrequency: allows to enter a precise frequency (in Hertz) for a
strobe feature
* StrobeFreqRange: allows to enter 2 values (minimum and maximum) to
represent the range of frequencies (in Hertz) to simulate a strobo
effect (Fig. 2)
* Alias: This is a special capability preset to indicate that when in
this range, an alias should be triggered. An alias is a replacement of a
channel. See the link:#aliases[Aliases tab] to understand how to define
aliases

Remove the selected capabilities from the channel.

Create new capabilities quickly with the capability wizard.

[[cap_wizard]]
===== Capability wizard

Capability Wizard is a handy tool for creating multiple capability value
ranges of the same size. Usually this applies to fixed colors, gobo
indices and various macro channels.

!*Name* !The common name for each capability. You can use the hash mark
# to denote a place for an index number (i.e. "Gobo #" creates Gobo 1,
Gobo 2, Gobo 3...)

fixture can be configured to.

[[aliases]]
==== Aliases Tab

In this tab it is possible to define the rules of replacement triggered
by capabilities set as "Alias" preset. +
Let's make an example. A fixture has channel 5 named "Effects" which
controls the behavior of channel 6. Channel 5 has 2 capabilities: "Speed
on channel 6" and "Sound sensitivity on channel 6". The latter have been
set to the "Alias" preset. By default, when DMX value of channel 5 is 0,
channel 6 acts as speed control. When DMX value of channel 5 enters the
"sound sensitivity" capability, channel 6 becomes a sound sensitivity
adjustment. +
To cope with this case, you need to define 2 channels: "Speed" and
"Sound sensitivity". In the fixture mode add only "Speed", since it will
the default behavior when DMX value of channel 5 is equal to 0. +
Then you need to define just one alias: the one that will replace the
default channel "Speed" with "Sound sensitivity". QLC+ will then know
what to do when the DMX value of channel 5 enters or exits the alias.
